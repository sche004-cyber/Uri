"""Lease ownership provenance (M33.3-R S10; Plan B R1.6, M33.2 §10).

Provider runtimes (LM Studio, Ollama, llama.cpp server) own residency: TTL,
idle unload, JIT loading and eviction stay provider-native. URI adds only what
it lacks: a record of which loaded instances URI itself created, so URI never
unloads or evicts a model it does not own. Seeing a model in LM Studio or
Ollama never implies permission to evict it.

Scope: one thread-safe ledger per server process (M33.2 §10), never per user.
Not wired into any production request path.
