"""Deterministic approval enforcement (Milestone 7 — Real Approval
Gate).

This is the ONE execution boundary this codebase should ever call for
a registered capability's execute_tool() - see orchestrator.py's
process_user_input (the direct capability_selected branch) and
workflow_capability_router.py's draft_output, both of which now call
this gate instead of ToolDispatcher directly, so neither call site can
independently drift out of sync with the other or accidentally bypass
approval enforcement.

Authority split (unchanged from ADR-018 / URI_MODEL_RUNTIME_CONTRACT):
CapabilityPlanner and any model-reasoning layer may only ever PROPOSE
a tool_name and arguments. Only this gate - consulting
CapabilityRegistry (Milestone 6) for approval_requirement and
ApprovalStore (this milestone) for a real, bound, single-use user
decision - decides whether ToolDispatcher.execute_tool() is ever
actually called. No model output reaches this gate directly: it only
ever sees the deterministic runtime's own already-selected tool_name/
arguments, exactly as ToolDispatcher already did before this
milestone. approve()/reject() are only ever invoked from an explicit,
separate user action (see server.py's POST /approve, POST /cancel) -
nothing in the request-processing path can call them on its own
behalf.

For a capability whose registry entry has approval_requirement !=
"user_approval_required" (every one of the 4 real tools, today),
execute_tool() below does exactly what ToolDispatcher.execute_tool()
already did before this milestone - one cheap registry lookup, then
an unconditional pass-through. See
test_capability_planner.py/test_capability_authority_boundary.py's
Milestone 6 regression tests, still passing unmodified, and this
milestone's own regression tests in test_approval_gate.py.
