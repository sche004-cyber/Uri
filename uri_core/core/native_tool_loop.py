"""M32 Batch C: Tier 0 (direct chat) and Tier 1 (native tool loop).

New module - per the standing PC4 rule, all new Batch C behaviour lands
here, never in orchestrator.py.

    - Tier 0 (C2): the Brain is offered tools=[...] and declines every
      one (an empty tool_calls tuple) - its own response content IS the
      reply, streamed tokens strengthening the Brain-authored-words rule
      by construction (no separate drafting call re-renders them). Tier 0
      is selected by the Brain's own choice, never by a URI-side
      classifier or keyword rule.
    - Tier 1 (C3): the Brain calls one or more tools. Each call is
      translated (tool_call_translator.py, C3.1) into the EXISTING
      Decision Contract shape and evaluated through the UNCHANGED
      evaluate_gates()/canonical_execution._execute_canonical() boundary -
      this module adds no new authorization logic.

Deliberate per-action (not per-contract) gate evaluation. Batching every
tool call from one Brain response into a single multi-action contract
would evaluate approval/permission in aggregate (decision_gates.py's own
`approval_required = any(...)` across all actions) and block a whole
batch merely because ONE action needs approval (finding SR-6/C3.8).
Evaluating each call as its OWN single-action contract instead - reusing
exactly the single-action path canonical_execution.py already runs in
production - gives branch preservation (C3.5) and mixed-approval handling
(C3.8) for free, without inventing new gate logic.
