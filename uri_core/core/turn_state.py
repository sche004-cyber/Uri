"""M30.1: canonical Turn State — a READ-ONLY projection over URI's
existing live state (docs/plans/URI_CANONICAL_AGENT_LOOP_MIGRATION_PLAN.md
§2, itself derived from docs/architecture/URI_CANONICAL_AGENT_LOOP_
ARCHITECTURE.md §3).

This module answers exactly one question - "what does URI know, right
now, at this turn?" - as one coherent, structured, throwaway dict. It is
NOT a new store: nothing here is persisted, nothing here is the
authoritative copy of anything. Every field is either read fresh from an
existing store each call (`recent_conversation`, `capability_summaries`,
`active_pointer`, `attempt_history`, `session_facts`) or passed through
verbatim from a value the CALLER already fetched elsewhere
(`durable_memory_relevant`, `graph_context`) - this module never fetches
memory or graph content itself, per the M30.1 migration-plan boundary
("no new ingestion or retrieval paths").

Nothing in `uri_core/core/orchestrator.py` calls this module yet. Per
the accepted migration plan, Turn State is introduced as a standalone,
independently testable projection first - it becomes part of the live
decision path only in a later, separately-authorized milestone (M30.5
onward). Constructing or calling this module has zero effect on any
existing request; it is exercised only by its own tests today.

Field provenance (source module / authoritative owner / how it is
projected / lifetime / sensitivity) - kept here as the single place this
is documented, referenced by the M30.1 completion report rather than
duplicated:

    turn                  - the caller's own request; principal is never
                             stored here as an object, only its user_id
                             (an identifier, not a secret). Lifetime: this
                             call only.
    recent_conversation    - uri_core.core.conversation_history.
                             ConversationHistoryStore (unchanged owner).
                             Referenced: read fresh, bounded to the most
                             recent N turns, never copied durably.
    active_pointer         - uri_core.core.state.Session's existing
                             active_workflow*/active_workflow_question
                             fields (unchanged owner). Derived: this
                             module only reshapes those fields into one
                             {kind, question, missing_field, reference}
                             record: it does not read or write anything
                             Session itself does not already hold.
    attempt_history        - Session.last_goal_attempt_history (unchanged
                             owner, already produced by orchestrator.py's
                             own existing carry-forward logic). Referenced
                             verbatim.
    session_facts          - Session.fact_history (unchanged owner).
                             Summarized: name/value/status only, never
                             the full Fact record (drops verified_by/

                             re-expose).
    capability_summaries   - uri_core.core.capability_feasibility.
                             CapabilityFeasibility (legacy, connection-
                             aware) concatenated with
                             uri_core.capabilities.MultiActionCapability
                             Registry.capability_summaries() (M27) - each
                             entry tagged with its own "source" so the
                             two catalogues' different vocabularies are
                             never silently merged into one shape this
                             early (Stage 1 §11.6's own finding: they are
                             not equivalent yet). Referenced: read fresh
                             every call, never cached.
    runtime_health         - the caller's own already-resolved active
                             provider/model id, cross-checked (if a
                             uri_core.core.model_router.
                             ProviderHealthTracker instance is given)
                             against its real, in-memory (never
                             persisted) health state. Derived.
    durable_memory_relevant, graph_context
                           - NEVER fetched here. Accepted only as an
                             already-computed value the caller passed in
                             (e.g. from the existing
                             personalization_context/graph_self_context
                             call sites) - a pure pass-through, present
                             only to prove the shape can carry this data
                             once a later milestone wires real retrieval
                             through Turn State instead of around it.
    grounded_entities      - always empty this milestone (the generalized
                             context resolver is M30.6's scope) - reported
                             as an explicit empty dict plus a note in
                             `unavailable_fields`, never fabricated.

Never included, under any circumstance: raw credentials/OAuth tokens
(only `connection_status`'s own already-redacted status/detail strings
reach `capability_summaries`, via CapabilityFeasibility, unchanged),
the `principal` object itself (only `principal.user_id`), full attachment
bytes, or raw audit-trail/security-guard internals.
