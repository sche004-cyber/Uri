"""URI's capability self-knowledge: one authoritative, curated
descriptor per capability, distinguishing what CapabilityPlanner/
ToolDispatcher can actually execute today from what is merely planned
or not yet implemented.

This module is reporting/query-only. It never executes anything, never
grants authorization or approval, and must never be imported by
anything that decides what to execute (dispatcher.py) - only by
capability_planner.py's gap-reporting path (informational) and
server.py's GET /capabilities (informational).

Reads uri_workspace/capabilities_registry.json - the same file
ToolDispatcher/CapabilityPlanner already read, restructured (not
duplicated) to carry descriptor metadata alongside the existing
execution fields (file_path/class_name/method) each already-registered
tool's entry has always had. See that file for the full shape.

Deliberately does NOT read uri_workspace/skill_registry.json. That
file (362 entries, built by build_skill_registry_v1.py from an
automated inventory scan, mostly-empty descriptive fields) is not
authoritative for "what can URI actually do" - it remains consumed
only by the dormant SkillEvaluatorV1/SkillRouterV1 shadow path
(orchestrator.py's _run_skill_router_shadow), unrelated to this
module.

Two capability statuses exist alongside "implemented":
    planned         - URI conceptually knows this is a future
                      capability; no executable backing exists.
    not_implemented - same as planned, used interchangeably by intent
                      (both mean "cannot execute this"); kept as two
                      words so a curated entry can say which is true
                      today without this module treating them
                      differently. Neither is ever selectable by
                      CapabilityPlanner.plan() - see
                      test_capability_planner.py.

Unknown-safe throughout: a missing or invalid field degrades to a safe
"unknown"/empty default rather than being guessed or raising -
mirroring UserProfileStore/MemoryStore/GrowthLedgerStore's existing
"degrade rather than crash on corrupted local state" discipline.
