"""Deterministic approval state for individual proposed actions
(Milestone 7 — Real Approval Gate).

This is runtime-owned state, not model output. Nothing here is ever
constructed, mutated, or satisfied by a model response - a
ProposedAction is created only by ApprovalGate.execute_tool() (see
approval_gate.py) when the deterministic runtime itself decides a
CapabilityRegistry-declared approval_requirement applies, and it is
only ever approved/rejected by an explicit call recording a real
user decision (see server.py's POST /approve and POST /cancel).

An approval is bound to one specific invocation, not to a capability
name in general:
    - action_id     - a runtime-generated uuid4, never model-supplied.
    - capability_id - the exact tool_name this approval covers.
    - session_id    - the exact session it was proposed and must be
                      consumed in.
    - arguments     - the exact arguments it covers, plus a SHA-256
                      arguments_fingerprint used to detect any drift
                      between what was approved and what a caller
                      later tries to execute.

Every one of those four must match at consumption time (see
ApprovalStore.consume()) - approval for one action can never satisfy
a different capability, a different session, or the same capability
with different arguments. Consumption is single-use: a second
consume() for the same action_id always fails, which is this store's
replay-prevention control.

A pending action that is never decided, or an approved action that is
never consumed, expires after DEFAULT_EXPIRY_SECONDS - a stale
decision can never be resurrected to authorize a later, unrelated
request.

Persistence follows GrowthLedgerStore/MemoryStore's exact pattern
(JSON file, schema_version, safe degrade on a corrupted file) with one
important difference: degrading to an empty list on a corrupted or
missing file is exactly the correct fail-closed behaviour here -
empty means nothing is approved, so ApprovalGate can never mistake a
corrupted store for permission to execute.
