"""M30.6: Controlled canonical execution - the FIRST milestone in this
sequence where the Brain Decision Contract + deterministic gate
pipeline (M30.3-M30.5D) is allowed to control real execution, for a
small, explicitly allowlisted set of capabilities only.

Governing constraints, enforced structurally by this module (not by
convention):

    - Default OFF (`URI_ENABLE_DECISION_ENGINE_LIVE` unset). When off,
      `run_canonical_for_ask()` is never reached from server.py at all
      (mirrors `URI_ENABLE_DECISION_ENGINE_SHADOW`'s own gating).
    - Allowlist-only: `CANONICAL_EXECUTION_ALLOWLIST` names the exact
      two capabilities the accepted migration plan's Phase C names
      (`URI_CANONICAL_AGENT_LOOP_MIGRATION_PLAN.md` §4) - Gmail
      (multi-action) and `remember_fact` (legacy). Nothing else can
      ever reach real execution through this module, regardless of
      what the model proposes.
    - Execution is allowed ONLY when the deterministic gate (M30.5's
      `decision_gates.evaluate_gates()`, reused unchanged) returns
      READY. Every other outcome (MISSING_PARAMETER, DISCONNECTED,
      UNAVAILABLE, PERMISSION_DENIED, APPROVAL_REQUIRED, UNSUPPORTED,
      INVALID_PROPOSAL, DEGRADED) falls back to the existing legacy
      `/ask` result untouched - this module never executes on any of
      them, and never invents a deterministic handling path of its own
      for a protected action; approval-required cases flow through the
      existing ApprovalGate/ApprovalStore pending-decision mechanism.
      (M32.1 correction: prior to M32.1 this was true only for the
      legacy `remember_fact` path - a Gmail APPROVAL_REQUIRED outcome
      had no durable ApprovalStore record at all, so it could never be
      resumed on a later turn. M32.1's `_propose_durable_gmail_approval()`
      bridges the Gmail single-action branch to a real, durable
      `ApprovalStore.propose()` call, making this claim true for both
      paths. The multi-step Gmail chain branch is still out of scope -
      see `approval_resumption.py`'s module docstring.)
    - No new invocation mechanics: Gmail actions execute through
      `MultiActionDispatch.dispatch_explicit()`/`dispatch_chain_explicit()`
      (M30.6, `multi_action_dispatch.py`) - thin wrappers around the
      SAME `MultiActionExecutor.execute()`/`execute_chain()` the legacy
      `dispatch()` path already used, with the Brain Decision
      Contract's explicit `capability`/`actions` fields replacing
      `dispatch()`'s own undocumented model-proposal-shape trigger
      (exactly the migration the accepted plan's §1 MultiActionDispatch
      row describes). `remember_fact` executes through the existing,
      unchanged `ApprovalGate.execute_tool()` boundary - the same one
      every legacy capability already uses.
    - Body -> Brain feedback: real execution evidence is packaged into
      the same `{"plan", "execution", "response"}` envelope shape
      `orchestrator.py`'s own legacy branches already build, then
      handed to the orchestrator's own existing, unchanged
      `_draft_narrative_safely()` - which only ever drafts from
      already-decided `execution`/`response` fields and independently
      validates claim-consistency (see that method's own docstring) -
      so a narrative can never claim more than the real evidence
      supports, without a second, new drafting/validation mechanism.
