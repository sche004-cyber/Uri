    """M19: the tool's OWN reported outcome, not just whether the Python
    call raised.

    execute_tool() reports status="success" for any call that returned
    without an exception, wrapping the tool's own result dict as
    "data" - but a tool's own dict very often carries a genuinely
    different status of its own ("input_required", "unavailable",
    "not_found", "error", ...) when it could not actually do what was
    asked (e.g. web_search.py returns {"status": "input_required"} for
    a missing query, wrapped inside a dispatcher envelope that still
    says {"status": "success"}). A caller that only reads the outer
    envelope status therefore sees "success" even when the tool
    reported it could not act - this is what let a workflow step (and
    the final response) be reported as completed/successful while the
    tool underneath said otherwise (M19 audit findings #3/#8).

    Returns the tool's own "data.status" whenever the dispatcher call
    itself succeeded AND the tool's own result is a dict with its own
    status string; otherwise returns the dispatcher-level status
    unchanged (a genuine dispatch failure, an approval-pending result,
    or a tool result with no separate status of its own all pass
    through as before - this never invents a status that was not
    already present somewhere in the result)."""
