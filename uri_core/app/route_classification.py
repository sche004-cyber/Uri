"""M22.3: the single source of truth for every registered route's
PUBLIC | USER | ADMIN classification (see
docs/plans/M22.3_SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md section 4).

PUBLIC             - no login concept applies (a true public route, or one
                      of the five diagnostic GETs the accepted plan
                      explicitly defers rather than reclassifies - see
                      DEFERRED_PUBLIC_ROUTES below).
USER               - the pre-existing Optional[str] =
                      Depends(_resolve_authenticated_user_id) pattern: an
                      authenticated caller gets their own isolated state,
                      an anonymous caller gets the single shared
                      legacy-ambient state. This fallback is a standing
                      architecture decision (URI_M22_ARCHITECTURE.md
                      section 20.7) retained through all of M22, not a gap
                      this table is asserting should be closed.
ADMIN              - must 401 anonymous, 403 non-admin, and succeed only
                      for a logged-in ADMIN.

This table exists specifically so a new route can never silently default
to public: test_m22_3_route_authorization.py walks app.routes and asserts
every (method, path) pair appears here, with the exact count also
checked, so an added-but-unclassified route fails CI immediately rather
than being caught only if someone remembers to test it by hand.

Do not add a route here as an act of granting it authority - this module
is a record of what server.py's own Depends(...) wiring already does; the
actual authorization decision is made in authorization.py/server.py, not
here.
