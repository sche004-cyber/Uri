"""Capability: upload the most recently generated/attached file in this
conversation to Google Drive (M19) - never overwrites, moves, renames,
or deletes anything; only ever creates a new file.

Registered approval_requirement=user_approval_required (see
capabilities_registry.json) - never executes without an explicit human
decision, exactly like gmail_create_draft.

Deliberately does not accept a filename/file_id argument from the
model: the file is resolved deterministically from FileStore by
session_id (the runtime-supplied, real session this conversation is
actually in), taking the most recently stored record - the same file a
prior generate_document/draft_institutional_note step in THIS
conversation just produced, or a file the user themselves attached.
This is the one missing link for the audit's end-to-end office
workflow ("... generate DOCX/PPTX -> save to Drive -> ...").
