"""Capability: convert an already-attached document into a different
file format (2026-09-12, User directive - "convert this into a word
file").

Today: PDF -> DOCX only, the concrete case reported.

Native-tool audit Pilot 3 (docs/plans/URI_NATIVE_TOOL_PILOTS.md): the
PRIMARY path is now real, layout-preserving conversion via
services/pdf_layout_converter.py (wraps `pdf2docx`) - page size/
orientation, margins, paragraph structure, fonts/styles, spacing,
tables, and images are reconstructed, not just extracted text. This
replaces plain-text-extraction-and-rebuild as the default outcome for
an ordinary "convert this to Word" request, which previously always
discarded layout - honestly disclosed at the time, but a real gap
relative to what a user asking to convert a document actually expects.

The plain-text path (services/pdf_reader.py + document_writer_service.py,
the same renderer generate_document.py uses) is kept as an honest
FALLBACK only - used when layout-preserving conversion genuinely fails
(reported "degraded", never "success"), and for the separate "convert
AND also edit the content" case (services/pdf_reader.py + Content edit is
a text-level operation pdf2docx's structural reconstruction cannot
accommodate; this is disclosed as reduced-fidelity too, not silently
presented as a full-fidelity conversion).

Stored through FileStore (containment-checked, size/type-validated,
session-scoped), so the result is downloadable via the existing GET
/files/{file_id}/content, same as generate_document/draft_institutional_
note/order.
