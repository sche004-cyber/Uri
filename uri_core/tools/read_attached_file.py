"""M16 Priority 1: read a file the user attached to this conversation.

Pure machinery, exactly mirroring web_search.py/gmail_search.py: the
Brain decides whether reading an attachment is needed (it can see that
attachments exist from query_context's "attachments" section - see
orchestrator.py); this tool performs the real extraction and returns
the real text as evidence. It never decides what the document means,
never drafts an answer, and never invents content when extraction
fails or the document is empty.

URI supplies the session and user-scoped FileStore. An optional file_id
selects one record only after checking that it belongs to this session.

Reuses services/file_extraction.extract_file_text (which in turn
reuses PDFReader/openpyxl/pytesseract) and core/file_store.FileStore
for containment-checked path resolution - no extraction, validation,
or path handling is reimplemented here.
