"""Capability: search/read files the user already has access to in
Google Drive (M19).

Read-only - reuses DriveService exactly as it already exists (no new
OAuth scope, no change to what URI is authorized to do in Drive).
Closes the audit's #3 gap that DriveService was never registered as a
capability at all, so the Brain could never search or read Drive
despite the service already being real and working.
