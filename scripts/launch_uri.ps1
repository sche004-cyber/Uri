.SYNOPSIS
    One-click startup for URI on Windows: brings up the backend API
    server (if it isn't already running) and then opens the Windows
    desktop app, in that order, without requiring the user to type any
    command themselves.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script is pure process orchestration - it contains no Brain
    reasoning, orchestration, or business logic of its own. It only
    ever starts two things that already exist unmodified:
      1. The backend, via the existing, previously-accepted
         scripts/uri_server_ctl.ps1 (a persistent per-user Scheduled
         Task wrapping scripts/run_uri_server.py). Reused as-is, not
         reimplemented - this script adds only what that one doesn't
         already do: deciding whether starting it is even necessary,
         waiting for it to actually become reachable, and reporting
         clearly if it never does.
      2. The already-built Windows desktop app
         (build\windows\x64\runner\Release\uri_ui.exe). This script
         does not build it - see README note in the repo root's
         "Launch URI.bat" / this milestone's report for when a rebuild
         is needed.

    Safe to run repeatedly: if the backend is already reachable, it is
    left alone (no restart, no duplicate task start - Task Scheduler's
    own MultipleInstances=IgnoreNew setting, already configured by
    uri_server_ctl.ps1, makes a second Start-ScheduledTask call while
    one is running a no-op regardless). If the desktop app is already
    running, this script brings its window forward instead of opening
    a second instance.

.PARAMETER Port
    Backend port to check/start on (default 8000, matching both
    scripts/run_uri_server.py's default and uri_ui's own compiled-in
    default backend address).

.EXAMPLE
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\launch_uri.ps1
