# URI Agent Guide

Start from the documented baseline; do not repeat completed architecture or
security audits merely to resume work.

## Current state

- The completed baseline is M22.2 at commit `34839ce`; its delivery record is
  1,141/1,141 tests passing.
- The next milestone is **M22.3: endpoint authorization and route
  classification**. Its scope and acceptance criteria are in
  [URI_M22_ARCHITECTURE.md](URI_M22_ARCHITECTURE.md).
- Uncommitted `uri_ui` Windows/platform work is active and unverified. It is
  not a milestone and must not be represented as one until scoped, verified,
  and committed.

## Governing documents

Read these before changing architecture, authority, model behaviour, or
milestone status:

1. [ADR-018](URI_Model_Centric_Architecture_Docs/URI_ADR_018_MODEL_CENTRIC_ARCHITECTURE.md)
   — model-centric intelligence and lightweight deterministic runtime.
2. [URI AI Operating Policy](URI_Model_Centric_Architecture_Docs/URI_AI_OPERATING_POLICY.md)
   — identity, behaviour, and non-negotiable safeguards.
3. [Model ↔ Runtime Contract](URI_Model_Centric_Architecture_Docs/URI_MODEL_RUNTIME_CONTRACT.md)
   — untrusted model proposals and runtime authority.
4. [URI M22 Architecture](URI_M22_ARCHITECTURE.md) — M22 sequence, security
   findings, dependencies, and deferred work.
5. [Milestone Tracker](URI_MILESTONE_TRACKER.md) and
   [Project Memory](PROJECT_MEMORY.md) — current delivery state and handoff.
6. [Multi-Agent Orchestration Architecture](ORCHESTRATION.md)
   — canonical AO-4 agent team roles, coordination loop, and workflow rules.
7. [URI Four-Stage Development Lifecycle](docs/governance/URI_FOUR_STAGE_DEVELOPMENT_LIFECYCLE.md)
   — mandatory four-stage lifecycle (Audit → Architecture → Migration → Validation) and permanent acceptance rule for all future add-ons.
8. [URI Active Milestone Control](docs/governance/URI_ACTIVE_MILESTONE.md)
   — single authoritative record of current approved milestone, state, authorized scope, agent roles, and stop conditions.

Do not duplicate or weaken these documents in implementation notes.

## Canonical Development Team (AO-4) — Authoritative Process

The development operating model follows the authoritative cycle established by the User (see [ORCHESTRATION.md](ORCHESTRATION.md) for the full detail this summary condenses):

**Auditor precedence (owner directive 2026-10-15):** For development milestones
governed by `uri-development-lifecycle`, including URI Hybrid UI work, Codex
CLI is the preferred independent code/security and final acceptance auditor;
when Codex is unavailable, a separate Claude process is the fallback. Neither
may audit its own implementation. This later directive supersedes the AO-4
Claude-only final-auditor role and the 2026-09-16 UI initiative's
planning-only restriction on Claude and Codex **for independent lifecycle
audit only**. Antigravity's UI implementation/repair roles and Qwen's
blueprint review remain in place; Qwen's review does not replace the lifecycle
audit. The lifecycle's owner-approval, frozen-path, and integration gates
still apply. The roles and cycle below retain their historical record.

1. **Claude (CLI):** Architect / Pre-Auditor / Final Auditor / Bounded Fixer / Release Authority.
   - Plans and pre-audits each next milestone before implementation.
   - Performs the independent final audit of the implementation, tracing actual production paths rather than trusting a worker's report.
   - If Claude finds a **bounded** defect within accepted scope, Claude fixes it directly, then independently re-audits (`audit → fix → re-audit`). Does not hand NOT VERIFIED findings back to Gemma/Codex by default.
   - If a defect requires **substantial** remediation, Claude defines the requirement and hands it to Antigravity for Codex/Gemma routing — Claude does not perform substantial implementation itself merely because it holds bounded-fix authority, and never silently expands an accepted milestone's scope while fixing something.
   - Once independently VERIFIED, Claude alone performs `git commit` and `git push` to `origin/master`.
   - Immediately plans and pre-audits the next milestone; the workflow does not stop merely because a milestone was pushed.
2. **Antigravity (Gemini 3.8 Flash):** Development Loop Manager / Orchestrator.
   - Manages execution of the accepted milestone: initiates tasks, prepares precise task-initiation packages, and invokes the appropriate worker (Claude, Codex, Gemma, or a specialist agent) as the workflow requires.
   - Routes implementation to Codex (preferred for complex/multi-file/security-sensitive/production-call-path work) or Gemma (bounded/small/repetitive/boilerplate work).
   - Sends task-initiation prompts to Gemma/Codex and packages evidence for Claude's audit.
   - Implements UI, UX-facing behavior, and URI response/reply interface work only where specifically assigned.
   - Coordinates agents, maintains milestone state, and ensures the next valid workflow stage is actually initiated.
   - **Is NOT the formal auditor/verifier.** Must not declare VERIFIED, must not replace Claude's independent verification, and must not commit or push a milestone release.
3. **Codex (CLI):** Preferred Specialist Coder / Implementer.
   - The preferred implementation worker for complex implementation, multi-file work, architectural implementation, security-sensitive work, persistence/integration work, difficult debugging, precision-critical changes, repository-wide reasoning, and production call-path changes.
   - Implements against the accepted Claude plan (or a Claude-defined remediation requirement).
   - Does not approve its own implementation, declare VERIFIED, redefine accepted architecture, commit, or push.
4. **Gemma 4 12B (local, via Ollama/MCP):** Local Bounded Implementation Worker.
   - Used primarily for small bounded implementation tasks, focused edits, repetitive work, boilerplate, focused test creation, and low-risk tasks that comfortably fit its context/capabilities.
   - Do not force complex implementation through Gemma when Codex is the more appropriate implementation worker.
   - No Git authority; no final release audit.
5. **Specialist / Design Agents:** Advisory only — may propose architecture improvements, UI/UX, interface layouts, and URI response/reply presentation/interaction-workflow improvements. Do not implement. Where a proposal materially affects architecture or milestone behavior, Claude reviews it before it becomes implementation guidance.
6. **User:** Final Authority. Non-delegable authority over architecture and security policy. Release itself is performed solely by Claude (item 1), not by the User directly.
   - **Default auto-approval (2026-09-11, permanent):** all future milestone plans are auto-approved by default — Claude proceeds `DRAFT → ACCEPTED` itself for routine engineering work without waiting for explicit ACCEPT/MODIFY. The User is interrupted only when a decision would materially change URI's core project structure, fundamental product identity, security/authority model, or another constitutional boundary. See [ORCHESTRATION.md](ORCHESTRATION.md) §1.5.
   - **Permanent quota-exhaustion invariant (2026-09-11):** Antigravity must place the workflow into a durable `WAITING_FOR_MODEL` state (never `BLOCKED`, never a failed task, never silent model substitution) when Claude or Codex is temporarily unavailable, and resume idempotently from the persisted checkpoint when it returns. See [ORCHESTRATION.md](ORCHESTRATION.md) §3.1.
7. **UI-Initiative Role Override (2026-09-16, explicit User instruction, current standing roles):** for the URI Hybrid UI implementation initiative (and until the User changes it again), the roles above are superseded as follows — this is additive history, not a silent rewrite of the original AO-4 roles, which remain the record for prior/other milestones:
   - **Claude (CLI) and Codex (CLI): planning and independent plan review only.** Neither implements UI (or reconciled backend) production code for this initiative, and neither performs the bounded-fix/audit/release role AO-4 previously gave Claude for this work.
   - **Antigravity (Gemini 3.8 Flash): primary implementer** for this initiative — builds against the frozen blueprint directly, in addition to its existing Loop Manager/Orchestrator duties.
   - **Qwen 3 14B (local Ollama): implementation review** for this initiative — reviews Antigravity's implementation against the frozen blueprint and produces concrete findings. This supersedes Qwen's normal "reserve/fallback, User-invoked only" status for this initiative specifically.
   - **Antigravity (Gemini 3.8 Flash): repair** of the concrete findings Qwen's review produces, for this initiative.
   - See `docs/plans/UI_HYBRID_FROZEN_BLUEPRINT.md` for the full sequencing (including mandatory sequencing behind M31) and `docs/governance/URI_ACTIVE_MILESTONE.md` for the authoritative current-state record under this role set.

### Standing Development Cycle (AO-4 historical record; auditor precedence above applies)
```
CLAUDE PLANS → CLAUDE PRE-AUDITS → USER ACCEPTS → ANTIGRAVITY INITIATES TASKS (ROUTES TO CODEX OR GEMMA PER COMPLEXITY) → CODEX/GEMMA IMPLEMENTS → ANTIGRAVITY MANAGES UI/RESPONSE WORK WHERE ASSIGNED → ANTIGRAVITY SENDS RELEVANT EVIDENCE TO CLAUDE → CLAUDE AUDITS → [BOUNDED DEFECT: CLAUDE FIXES DIRECTLY → CLAUDE RE-AUDITS] OR [SUBSTANTIAL DEFECT: CLAUDE DEFINES REMEDIATION → ANTIGRAVITY ROUTES TO CODEX/GEMMA → CLAUDE RE-AUDITS] → VERIFIED → CLAUDE COMMITS/PUSHES → CLAUDE PLANS NEXT MILESTONE → USER ACCEPTS → REPEAT
```


## Non-negotiable boundaries

- The model may reason and propose; the runtime validates, authorizes,
  approves, executes, persists, audits, and reports.
- Preserve the propose → validate → approve → execute chain across both URI runtime behavior and development orchestration. Coordinator and model outputs are untrusted proposals and cannot grant capability, approval, or execution authority.
- Keep deterministic runtime controls focused on safety, authority, state
  integrity, and execution; do not replace model reasoning with task-specific
  hard-coded logic.
- Keep user data isolated. `experience_tier` is UX-only and must never become
  an authorization input.
- Do not treat a route as safe merely because a caller is authenticated:
  route classification and role enforcement are M22.3's explicit work.
- In prompt context assembly for the coordinator, Antigravity must explicitly inject negative constraints (prohibited features, deferred work, protected files) as first-class context to prevent scope drift.
- **Permanent Acceptance Rule:** "A feature is not DONE merely because its code exists or its unit tests pass. It is complete only when the Brain can discover and use it through URI's canonical agent loop, execution results are fed back into reasoning, and the user-visible behavior has been live-verified end-to-end."
- **Four-Stage Development Lifecycle:** Every new add-on, capability, connector, integration, memory feature, graph feature, model feature, automation, workflow, UI-to-backend feature, skill, or future extension must strictly follow the four stages:
  1. *Stage 1 — Evidence & Root-Cause Audit* (`docs/research/<M>_ROOT_CAUSE_AUDIT.md`)
  2. *Stage 2 — Canonical Architecture Design* (`docs/architecture/<M>_CANONICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md`)
  3. *Stage 3 — Migration & Integration Plan* (`docs/plans/<M>_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`)
  4. *Stage 4 — Implementation & End-to-End Validation* (component, integration, agent-loop behavioral, and live UI verification)
  No add-on may bypass this lifecycle unless it is a clearly bounded local bug fix with known root cause, minimal local scope, no architectural impact, and regression coverage. See [URI Four-Stage Development Lifecycle](docs/governance/URI_FOUR_STAGE_DEVELOPMENT_LIFECYCLE.md).

## Working practice

- Before asking the User for milestone-specific coordination approval, read
  [docs/governance/URI_ACTIVE_MILESTONE.md](docs/governance/URI_ACTIVE_MILESTONE.md).
  If the requested read/write/task scope is already explicitly authorized
  there, proceed within that scope without asking again. If the requested
  action exceeds that scope, ask for approval.
- Inspect only the files necessary for the assigned scope. Preserve unrelated
  dirty-worktree changes.
- Do not modify application code or tests during documentation-only work.
- For an implementation milestone, make the smallest coherent change, add or
  update the milestone's required tests, and run proportionate verification.
- Record a milestone as complete only after its specified verification and
  commit checkpoint. Do not use uncommitted work as evidence of completion.
- Update the tracker and project memory when a milestone changes state; link
  to governing documents instead of copying architecture into them.

## Development lifecycle skill (2026-10-11)

Development milestones are driven by `uri-development-lifecycle` (`.claude/skills/uri-development-lifecycle/SKILL.md`,
engine `scripts/dev_workflow/lifecycle.py`, reference `docs/dev_workflow/URI_DEVELOPMENT_LIFECYCLE.md`). It extends
AO-4 with the auditor precedence stated above: independent review by Codex first, or by a separate Claude process when Codex is unavailable (owner directive
2026-10-15; Codex is preferred but never a reason to stop when a valid Claude fallback exists). User-facing work is
qualified live through the real URI Windows UI with a UX and onboarding loop (skill Stage 8).
It is a development skill only and is not part of the runtime skill registry.
