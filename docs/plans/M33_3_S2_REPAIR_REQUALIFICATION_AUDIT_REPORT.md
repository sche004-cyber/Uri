# M33.3 S2 — independent audit, bounded repair, requalification, and freeze

**Date:** 2026-09-26
**Verdict:** `S2_AUDIT_REPAIR_REQUALIFICATION_ACCEPTED`
**Scope:** S2 only. S1 remains closed/frozen; M33.3 remains incomplete; S3–S13 remain unauthorized.

## 1. Audit identity and authority

- Repository: `C:\Users\cheta\Development\Uri\_V1`; branch: `m35-uri-v1-parallel-architecture`; remote: `origin` (`https://github.com/sche004-cyber/uri-agent.git`). The independent audit began at local and remote HEAD `d8735dbf2f471e3c9e63389b30d66e60718bf2d0`; pre-S2 baseline is `2fa90fbbb1fc00ceca828adbdc90a5442c263892`.
- The pre-existing modified `SKILL.md` and extensive untracked M35/research work were left untouched and unstaged. A managed, detached baseline checkout at `2fa90fb` supplied comparison evidence.
- Normative sources: `M33_3_S2_STATE.md` §§1–12; Plan A R2.6 and R3.2/R4; Plan B R1.4; cross-plan audit §8; cross-plan state D1 and S2 U-1/U-2/U-3; frozen S1 state and its independent requalification; production `Action`, `LegacyCapabilityAdapter`, `MultiActionExecutor`, and `ApprovalGate` paths. The S2 implementation report was a claim to test, not audit evidence.
- D1 declares an unsent Gmail draft `RECOVERABLE` independently of `EffectType`. U-1 selects an opt-in `MultiActionExecutor` gate and defers caller wiring and the legacy `ApprovalGate` path. U-2 covers both draft actions. U-3 permits only those D1 declarations. S2 does not authorize S3 or production integration.

## 2. Finding, reproduction, and bounded repair

| Finding | Reproduction at `d8735db` | Frozen contract | Repair and regression |
|---|---|---|---|
| S2-F1: malformed binding could raise instead of failing closed | `object.__new__(ReferenceBinding)` inside a binding list raised `AttributeError` at `_valid_binding` when `ref_key` was absent. A foreign object with a raising `ref_key` property was read before type validation. | G3 requires malformed objects and missing fields to return `INVALID_REFERENCE_BINDING`; the executor must not call the handler. | In `wrong_binding.py`, require exact `ReferenceBinding` type, read each field with a missing-field fallback, and construct duplicate keys only after every item validates. Added cases for each missing field, a mixed valid/invalid list, a foreign raising property, and executor handler non-execution in `test_m33_3_s2_wrong_binding_impact.py`. |
| S2-F2: foreign string enum accepted as a low-impact declaration | A foreign `str, Enum` member with value `RECOVERABLE` was accepted by `Action.__post_init__` and by the adapter. | S2 state §4.2 permits a `WrongBindingImpact` or an exact value string; another enum type is invalid. Invalid descriptor metadata must remain undeclared without table fallback. | `coerce_declared_impact` now accepts only the S2 enum or `type(value) is str`; the adapter uses that same validator. Added an Action rejection and adapter fail-closed regression. |

The repairs change no policy or gate outcome for a valid binding or valid declared impact. The post-repair focused S2 battery is **146 passed**; S2 plus frozen S1 is **207 passed**. No further S2 defect was found in re-audit.

## 3. Independent contract matrix

| Requirement | Status | Evidence / limit |
|---|---|---|
| Three-value `Action.wrong_binding_impact` and optional undeclared state | SATISFIED | `WrongBindingImpact` has exactly `NONE`, `RECOVERABLE`, `CONSEQUENTIAL`; `Action` defaults to `None`; exact strings coerce at construction, invalid declarations reject. |
| Undeclared and tampered impact fail closed; no `EffectType` inference | SATISFIED | `effective_wrong_binding_impact` reads the live action on each call, returns `(CONSEQUENTIAL, False)` for `None`/invalid; all `EffectType` variants remain undeclared absent explicit declaration. Mutation and copied-action probes observe current values. |
| G1: absent bindings | SATISFIED | `None` yields `NOT_APPLICABLE`; executor continues its pre-S2 permission, schema, approval, handler, and audit path. |
| G2/G3: invalid bindings | SATISFIED after repair | Only list/tuple of exact, complete, valid bindings is accepted; unknown states, raw strings, subclasses, missing fields, mixed invalid lists, and duplicate keys return `INVALID_REFERENCE_BINDING`. |
| G4/G5/G6: empty, confirmed, safe tentative | SATISFIED | Empty list allows; all `CONFIRMED` allows even undeclared; tentative with declared `NONE`/`RECOVERABLE` allows, still subject to approval. |
| G7: consequential or undeclared tentative | SATISFIED | Blocks with `CONFIRM_ONE` and every tentative key; approval flags do not override; handler is not called. |
| Approval independence | SATISFIED | Wrong-binding confirmation grants no approval; approved consequential tentative remains blocked; legacy `ApprovalGate` source and behavior are unchanged. |
| Adapter propagation and D1-only declarations | SATISFIED | Explicit table contains only `gmail_create_draft`; Gmail multi-action `create_draft` is `RECOVERABLE`; every other Gmail action is undeclared. Valid descriptor value wins; invalid descriptor value stays undeclared without table fallback. |
| Per-action chains and freshness | SATISFIED | Each step gates its own action and supplied bindings; blocked step halts before later execution. Impact is not cached. |
| Caller completeness and production visibility | NOT_APPLICABLE to S2 acceptance | U-1 deliberately makes the gate opt-in; S13 owns complete S1 binding-state mapping and production wiring. Capability description/schema exposure is deferred by frozen S2 §8. |
| Protected boundary | SATISFIED | No S2 diff in `uri_v1`, `uri_ui`, Batch A fixtures, frozen S1 tests, legacy approval, orchestrator, or provider code. |

## 4. Regression, baseline, and adversarial evidence

- `python -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/test_m33_3_s2_wrong_binding_impact.py` after repair: **146 passed**.
- The same S2 file plus all `tests/test_m33_3_s1_*.py` files, expanded by PowerShell: **207 passed**.
- Deterministic RAR/ARN and Batch A structural plus `tests/governance`: **153 passed, 48 subtests passed** before the repair. Governance after closure: **37 passed**; `python scripts/governance/uri_state_validator.py`: **VALID, no DCL violations**.
- The capability/executor sweep defined in the S2 implementation report §7 reproduced **328 passed, 3 failed, 13 subtests passed** before and after repair. Each failure was independently rerun on clean `2fa90fb` and failed identically: one capability-directory privacy assertion serializes the text `credentials.json`; two production-composition tests need an unset `URI_EXTERNAL_CREDENTIAL_SECRET`. These are pre-existing/environment failures, not S2 regressions.
- The widest practical tracked-root sweep selected the 217 tracked `test_*.py` files except `_live`, `test_qwen_coordinator*`, and `test_gemma_worker_mcp`. On the S2 tree it returned **2591 passed, 58 skipped, 12 failed, 77 subtests passed** in 437.31 seconds; on clean `2fa90fb`, **2591 passed, 59 skipped, 11 failed, 77 subtests passed** in 426.66 seconds. Eleven failure IDs matched exactly: capability-directory privacy; five M20 feasibility/recovery/semantic-interpreter cases; two perception-corpus hash cases; orchestrator session workflow; usage import boundary; workflow restart recovery. The sole apparent extra failure was `test_m33_1_batch2_yt_dlp.py::TestM33_1Batch2YtDlp::test_execution_through_generic_cli_bridge_and_canonical_loop`, which invokes a public Wikimedia URL. An isolated rerun failed **identically on both trees** (`unavailable` versus expected `success`, ~19 seconds each), establishing an environment/network-sensitive failure rather than a new S2 regression. No failing root test exercises the S2 repair path. The pass-count parity is exact.
- Post-repair requalification: S2 + S1 **207 passed**; deterministic RAR/ARN + governance **153 passed, 48 subtests passed**; capability/executor **328 passed, the same 3 baseline failures, 13 subtests passed**; standalone governance **37 passed** and URI_STATE validator **VALID**. The broad root comparison began before the bounded repairs and served as baseline and regression classification; all changed production paths were rerun after repair in the focused and capability suites.

Adversarial probes covered invalid/tampered impact, foreign impact enum, undeclared impact, approved consequential tentative action, malformed/unknown status, foreign binding subclass and malformed object, duplicate key, missing fields, mixed invalid list, `None` and empty inputs, descriptor contradiction, impact mutation, copied Action, descriptor mutation after adaptation, a mixed-impact chain, and the legacy path boundary. The newly reproduced violations are now permanent regressions.

## 5. Accepted limitations and out-of-scope observation

- **Accepted/deferred:** U-1 means no current production caller supplies complete bindings. S13 must supply them and wire the live agent loop. Legacy `ApprovalGate.execute_tool` remains ungated under U-1. `describe_capability` and the external descriptor schema do not expose the field under S2 §8. These limits do not imply that live end-to-end behavior is already delivered.
- **`OUT_OF_SCOPE_PREEXISTING`:** Gmail multi-action `create_draft` still reports `effect_type=READ_ONLY`. This does not set wrong-binding impact; D1 explicitly separates the two classifications. No S2 repair to `EffectType` is authorized.

## 6. Protected integrity and governance

LF-normalized SHA-256 values, independently recomputed:

| Artifact | SHA-256 |
|---|---|
| `uri_v1/turn/rar_deterministic.py` | `e02af25bb7009d12d829c8b8fc92e487d3da75aeaa160092db617458278fb649` |

`git diff 2fa90fb d8735db -- uri_v1 uri_ui fixtures/m33_3_batch_a tests/test_m33_3_s1*` was empty, as was the protected-path diff after repair. The S2 implementation adds no model/provider/network dependency and no `uri_v1` import from `uri_core`. `git diff --check` on this transaction is clean; the unrelated modified `SKILL.md` has two pre-existing trailing-space lines and is excluded from staging.

The closure transaction updates `M33_3_S2_STATE.md`, `M33_3_CROSS_PLAN_STATE.md`, and `URI_STATE.yaml`: `S2_IMPLEMENTATION_AUDITED: YES`; `S2_REPAIRS_REQUIRED: YES`; `S2_REPAIRS_VERIFIED: YES`; `S2_CLOSED_FROZEN: YES`; `M33_3_COMPLETE: NO`; `NEXT_SLICE_AUTHORIZED: NO`. S1 stays frozen. The implementation report remains a historical submission and is not rewritten as an audit.

## 7. Final transaction

The audit accepts S2 after the bounded repairs and requalification. The closure commit contains only the two production repair files, the S2 regression test, this report, and the three S2 governance/state files:

- Closure commit: `a69c99d1a610d65d45bfb693308d2e1bc506ef95` (`M33.3 S2: audit, repair, and freeze wrong-binding gate`).
- Push result: `d8735db..a69c99d  HEAD -> m35-uri-v1-parallel-architecture` at `origin`.
- Independent remote verification immediately after push: `git ls-remote origin refs/heads/m35-uri-v1-parallel-architecture` returned `a69c99d1a610d65d45bfb693308d2e1bc506ef95`, matching local HEAD.
- This receipt is an additive report-only commit after the closure commit; its final hash is recorded in the final response because a commit cannot contain its own hash.

Stop before S3.
