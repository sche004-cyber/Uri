# M33.3 — Cross-Plan State: URI-REFERENCE-CLARIFICATION × URI Brain Architecture

**Current state (2026-09-28): `CLOSED_FROZEN`.** Independent closing verdict:
`ACCEPT_WITH_DOCUMENTED_LIMITATIONS`, under the User's one-session audit,
bounded-repair, requalification and release authorization. Evidence:
`docs/plans/M33_3_R_INDEPENDENT_CLOSING_AUDIT_REPORT.md`.

S1 (including corrected S1-A1), S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8, S10, S11 and
S12 are accepted/frozen within their documented offline/fixture-backed scope.
S9 is excluded and re-homed to URI-Memory/D4; S13 is excluded and requires a
future INT-* authorization. M33.3 is complete within this explicit boundary.
No model wording tier qualified; template is primary. S8 has one qualified
route; S12 remains fixture-only. No production adoption, model/residency-policy
freeze, research promotion, or next-slice authorization is created.

Final clean LF regression: 3,261 passed, 9 baseline failures, 66 skipped, 218 subtests passed; no new failures.
Flutter 204 passed; S12 analysis clean; one baseline full-app analyzer INFO.
Historical records below remain evidence of their dates, not current authority.

## Historical cross-plan state

**[Added 2026-09-27, M33.3-R]** Current state: `M33_3_R_IMPLEMENTATION_CANDIDATE_AWAITING_INDEPENDENT_CLOSING_AUDIT` — the User authorized S5, S6, S7, S8, S10, S11 and S12 as one continuous milestone (S9 re-homed to URI-Memory / D4; S13 a separate INT-* milestone). S1 was reopened only for User-authorized amendment S1-A1. See `docs/plans/M33_3_R_STATE.md` and `docs/plans/M33_3_R_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md`.

## 2. User decisions (recorded exactly, 2026-09-26)

**D1: wrong-binding impact for Gmail drafts.** User acceptance: `USER_ACCEPTANCE_SATISFIED` (2026-09-26). This decision is the User's acceptance of the `wrong_binding_impact` capability-contract classification; no further User acceptance is pending for it.
- `gmail_create_draft` is `RECOVERABLE`.
- Reason: creating an unsent draft can be corrected before external communication occurs.
- The classification is independent of `EffectType`, `ApprovalRequirement`, and `RiskLevel`.
- A future real send action is expected to be `CONSEQUENTIAL`.
- `wrong_binding_impact` must not be derived mechanically from `EffectType`.

**D2: intelligence/routing modes.**
- KEEP `EDGE_ONLY`, `HYBRID`, and `MAIN_BRAIN_PREFERRED`. Do not replace them with AUTO / selected-model / Edge-OFF, because those are different dimensions.
- **AUTO + HYBRID:** deterministic mechanisms first; a qualified Edge may perform substantive bounded work; the Capable Brain is used when Edge is not qualified or not sufficient.
- **AUTO + MAIN_BRAIN_PREFERRED:** deterministic mechanisms still run; substantive model work normally goes directly to the Capable Brain; a qualified Edge may perform supporting work.
- **Explicit model selected:**
  - the selected model becomes the Capable Brain for substantive model work;
  - deterministic URI mechanisms remain active;
  - qualified supporting Edge work remains permitted;
  - model-native capabilities must be preserved.
- **Edge OFF:** removes Edge inference only; deterministic URI mechanisms remain active; the Capable Brain remains available unless another explicit policy forbids it.
- **EDGE_ONLY:** deterministic URI mechanisms plus qualified Edge only; never silently call the Capable Brain; if the task exceeds those capabilities, surface the limitation or escalation requirement instead of violating the mode.
- HYBRID is efficiency-first. MAIN_BRAIN_PREFERRED is capability-first. Do not merge them.

**D3: model-assisted reference investigation.**
- Qualified Edge or Capable models MAY: investigate; interpret clues; compare grounded candidates; narrow candidates; annotate candidates; return structured evidence.
- They MAY NOT independently create binding authority. Model preference alone must not directly create a TENTATIVE binding.
- Required flow: model interpretation/investigation → structured grounded evidence → deterministic resolution/eligibility check → TENTATIVE / CONFIRMED / CLARIFY.
- RAR and deterministic mechanisms remain authoritative for candidate identity and binding state. Model output must never invent candidate IDs.

**D4: durable reference evidence. Status: `DEFERRED`** (not unresolved).
- Durable cross-session learned reference evidence is deferred to URI-Memory.
- **Allowed now:**
  - session-authoritative selections;
  - session-local reference evidence;
  - structured correction/Change events;
  - rank/display effects from valid session evidence.
- **Not authorized now:**
  - a new ad-hoc durable cross-session reference-memory subsystem;
  - durable learned tie-breaking without URI-Memory qualification.

**D5: CONFIRMED authority** (2026-09-26, during the S1 scoping audit). Only certainty-tier deterministic rules may produce `CONFIRMED`:
- `EXACT_ID`;
- `EXACT_ALIAS`;
- `ACTIVE_UI`;
- `CURRENT_ATTACHMENT` only when tied to `deterministic_anchor.current_attachment_id`;
- `EXACT_TITLE` only when tied to `deterministic_anchor.unique_title_match` or an equivalent unique verbatim-title anchor.

Other deterministic `RESOLVED` rules are only TENTATIVE-eligible through the R2.9 check. `CONSEQUENTIAL` or undeclared `wrong_binding_impact` → `CONFIRM_ONE`. The same authority classification applies to typed free input. This classifier lives outside frozen RAR/A9. Applied in Plan A R4.2–R4.5.

**D6: S1 boundary** (2026-09-26). S1 is the full state-file S1: deterministic clarification/binding core, deterministic template, RenderValidator, and `ClarificationBundle` / multi-reference contract. Do not split into S1/S1b. Applied in Plan A R4.7 and `docs/plans/M33_3_S1_STATE.md`.

**Free input with display overflow** (2026-09-26, User decision during the S1 fidelity follow-up repair, F-U3). Free input reruns over the full ambiguity scope RAR returned for that clarification round, including candidates not displayed because of the UI option cap. The display cap is a presentation constraint, not a reduction of binding scope. URI must not reconstruct candidates omitted or truncated by frozen RAR; the full ambiguity scope is exactly the candidate set RAR returned to the clarification layer for that round. Applied in Plan A R4.12 and `docs/plans/M33_3_S1_STATE.md`.

## 4. Slice readiness (updated after RG-0R `RG_0R_ACCEPTED` and the S1 scoping audit)

| Slice | Content | Classification | Gate(s) |
|---|---|---|---|
| G0 | Governance: Plan B durable, identities registered, decisions recorded | DONE (RG-0 and RG-0R accepted) | — |
| S1 | RC deterministic core in `uri_v1` against fixtures (contracts incl. `CONFIRM_ONE`, `CHOOSE_ATTRIBUTE` per R3.1, and bundle; builder, template, validator, `BindingService` with the R3.2 admissible states, lifecycle states, session adjunct, stop safeguards) | `S1_SCOPE_READY_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION_REVIEW` (scope frozen in `docs/plans/M33_3_S1_STATE.md`; full state-file S1 per D6). RG-0R passed. Implementation NOT authorized | PG-1 (RG-0R part satisfied); implementation authorization |
| S2 | `Action.wrong_binding_impact` production field + execution-gate check | `S2_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE_AWAITING_INDEPENDENT_AUDIT` (authorized 2026-09-26; plan frozen in `docs/plans/M33_3_S2_STATE.md`; was: BLOCKED only on implementation authorization) | PG-2 (satisfied); independent S2 audit |
| S3 | Battery L1/L2 (no model) | `S3_CLOSED_FROZEN` after independent audit, re-audit correction (F1 rows 18/19 coverage, F2 stale scope), bounded repair and requalification (battery v2, 82 cases; evidence: `docs/plans/M33_3_S3_REPAIR_REQUALIFICATION_AUDIT_REPORT.md`, `docs/plans/M33_3_S3_REAUDIT_CORRECTION_REQUALIFICATION_REPORT.md`) | PG-1 (satisfied) |
| S4 | Offline source-to-candidate / RAR-boundary replay (Plan B stage 1, D0/D1R/D1RQ) | `S4_CLOSED_FROZEN` after independent recovery audit and tracked-only replay repair; prior recovery-candidate and failed-audit records preserved in S4 state/reports. Experimental offline evidence only; no production adoption. | PG-5/PG-6 satisfied under explicit User Option B repair and full affected-layer requalification; old Batch A G-R2 pin detects historical drift, with frozen Stage A evidence retained and current deterministic decisions independently compared. |
| S5 | Wording qualification (template vs Edge vs Capable, User blind rating) | EXPERIMENT_REQUIRED | S1, S3 |
| S6 | Unified router extension (mode mapping, explicit selection, Edge OFF) | BLOCKED only on its own plan/authorization (RG-0R passed) | PG-3 (satisfied) |
| S7 | Response `trace_id` + structured evaluation event stream | PLAN_REQUIRED (no slice plan exists) | — |
| S8 | Route-performance store + learning replay | EXPERIMENT_REQUIRED | S6, S7 |
| S9 | Durable learned reference tie-break | **DEFERRED** (D4: URI-Memory) | URI-Memory + correction-rate experiment |
| S10 | Lease ownership + Capable Brain residency study | EXPERIMENT_REQUIRED | — |
| S11 | Result-version owner (Case H/I redo) | PLAN_REQUIRED (no owner exists; `uri_ui` editability UNVERIFIED). Plan A R3.2 I-6 depends on it: a post-execution redo must never silently overwrite a user-edited X-derived result; before S11 exists, any redo slice must fail closed | — |
| S12 | Clickable UI options in `uri_ui` | BLOCKED | S1 contract freeze |
| S13 | Production integration into `uri_core` | BLOCKED | S4 results, `URI-RAR` adoption, INT authorization |

## 5. Gates

- **RG-0 (done):** the independent cross-plan re-audit of Plan A R2, Plan B R1, the M33.2 amendments G1–G3, and this state file. Verdict `BOUNDED_REPAIR_REQUIRED` (see §5a).
- **RG-0R (done, `RG_0R_ACCEPTED`; see §5b):** a focused independent re-audit of the four RG-0 repairs (Plan A R3.1, R3.2, R3.3; Plan B R2; audit COR-5 and COR-6; this state file). It is performed by an agent other than the author of this repair pass.
- **PG-1:** RG-0R passes before S1. **Satisfied** (RG-0R accepted). S1 still needs implementation authorization.
- **PG-2:** RG-0R passes before S2. **Satisfied** (RG-0R accepted). User acceptance of the `wrong_binding_impact` capability-contract extension: `USER_ACCEPTANCE_SATISFIED` (D1, 2026-09-26). History: until this repair, PG-2 read "RG-0 passes and the `wrong_binding_impact` capability-contract extension is explicitly accepted before S2"; the acceptance half was already satisfied by D1.
- **PG-3:** **Satisfied** (RG-0R accepted). RG-0R passes before S6 (G2 fidelity was within RG-0's scope, and RG-0 raised no finding on it).
- **PG-4:** **Satisfied** (RG-0R accepted). RG-0R passes before any production wording path (G1 fidelity was within RG-0's scope, and RG-0 raised no finding on it).
- **PG-5:** S4 has its own plan, independently pre-audited, with hash anchors. The frozen Batch A battery (`06d0dfff…c3fa`) and A9 stay untouched. **Satisfied for S4 plan/implementation entry** by the independent pre-audit and focused rechecks recorded in `M33_3_S4_PLAN_INDEPENDENT_PREAUDIT.md` / `M33_3_S4_PLAN_FOCUSED_INDEPENDENT_REAUDIT.md`; this does not audit the implementation.
- **PG-6:** the A9 `rar_deterministic.py` SHA-256 `e02af25bb7009d12d829c8b8fc92e487d3da75aeaa160092db617458278fb649` is verified before and after any RAR-touching slice. **Satisfied for the historical S4 replay** by runner pre/post verification; independent recovery replay completed on 2026-09-27. **Re-pinned 2026-09-27 (S4 upstream recovery, User Option B):** RC-5 intentionally changed `rar_deterministic.py` to SHA-256 `4db775666868e09a9f7232707d67ec3b4070970a30145ad3c5b41bb86b5e1b95`; the S4 runner and the S1/S2 hash-pin tests now verify that value. The previous value above is kept as history. The implementer requested independent confirmation of this re-pin (`docs/plans/M33_3_S4_UPSTREAM_RECOVERY_REQUALIFICATION_REPORT.md` §6). **Independent audit 2026-09-27:** authorized Option B explicitly covers the RC-5 repair; old and new hashes are verified, affected layers requalified, and historical Batch A/A9 evidence is not silently re-pinned. The new hash is the current S4/S1/S2 verification anchor; the old hash remains the historical A9/Batch A anchor. See the independent S4 recovery audit report.

### 5a. RG-0 record (2026-09-26)

- **Verdict:** `BOUNDED_REPAIR_REQUIRED`.
- **Source:** the independent RG-0 cross-plan re-audit. Its findings reached the repair pass through the User's repair instruction. **The RG-0 report itself is not stored in the repository**; this section is the durable record of its findings as relayed. The gap does not affect the repairs, which were re-derived from repository evidence. RG-0R should treat the relayed findings as its scope.
- **Findings:**
  - **RG-0-F1:** incomplete `CHOOSE_ATTRIBUTE` interaction contract. Zero candidate options and 2–5 attribute choices were allowed, while the typed contract, render request, response payload, and binding path were candidate-only.
  - **RG-0-F2:** inconsistent Change / rebind / redo lifecycle. `CHANGED → redo → REDONE` did not require a validated rebind, and it conflicted with BindingService's pending-only admissibility.
  - **RG-0-F3:** inaccurate description of RAR scoring. "No scores" is contradicted by `DeterministicRARTrace.candidate_scores`.
  - **B-R7 clarification:** Plan B R1.7 implied that the existing `RARQuery` carries provenance and dependency information that it does not contain.
- **No new User product decision was required.** This was RG-0's finding, and this repair pass confirmed it: every repair was resolvable from repository evidence and the accepted decisions D1–D4.
- **Repairs applied:** see §3, rows RG-0-F1, RG-0-F2, RG-0-F3, and the B-R7 clarification.
- **D1 acceptance:** `USER_ACCEPTANCE_SATISFIED`. PG-2 no longer awaits User acceptance.
- **Implementation authorized:** NO. The active continuation was RG-0R (focused independent re-audit), not S1. `[Superseded by §5b: RG-0R accepted; S1 scope frozen; implementation still not authorized]`

### 5b. RG-0R and S1 scoping record (2026-09-26)

- **RG-0R verdict:** `RG_0R_ACCEPTED`. No blocking defects. RG-0-F1, RG-0-F2, RG-0-F3, and the B-R7 clarification are accepted. The two conservative repair calls are consistent and safe. The active planning phase may close. Implementation remains not authorized. Record: `docs/plans/M33_3_RG0R_FOCUSED_INDEPENDENT_REAUDIT_REPORT.md` (the full report text is not stored; the verdict is recorded as relayed).
- **S1 pre-implementation scoping audit:** `S1_SCOPE_READY_WITH_BOUNDED_FOLLOWUP`. The follow-up is governance recording only. User decisions D5 and D6 (§2). Evidence findings F-1 to F-6 (Plan A R4.1). The report is not stored in the repository; this record and Plan A R4 are its durable record as relayed.
- **Governance recording pass (this update):** P-1 recorded RG-0R; P-2 added Plan A R4; P-3 froze the S1 scope in `docs/plans/M33_3_S1_STATE.md` with state `S1_SCOPE_READY_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION_REVIEW`. No code, fixture, or protected artifact changed.
- **Planning phase:** closed.
- **S1 fidelity self-audit (2026-09-26):** `S1_FIDELITY_AUDIT_ACCEPTED_WITH_BOUNDED_FOLLOWUP`, no blocking defect. Claude performed it and also authored R4 and the S1 state, so it is not independent (disclosed). Follow-ups F-U1 (attribute-narrowed results never confirm directly), F-U2 (stale free-input wording markers), F-U3 (displayed option set vs round ambiguity scope; User decision in §2), and F-U4 (RG-0R record provenance) were closed by a docs-only repair. The audit was returned in chat and is not stored as a separate file; this bullet is its durable record.
- **Implementation authorized:** NO. `CODE_IMPLEMENTATION_AUTHORIZED: NO`. `S1_IMPLEMENTATION_AUTHORIZED: NO`. The next step is a separate User/governance implementation-authorization review of S1.

## 7. Re-audit handoff (RG-0; completed, verdict `BOUNDED_REPAIR_REQUIRED`)

The re-auditor should verify at least the following from repository evidence alone:
1. Plan B R0 matches the recorded SHA-256 and the transcript source.
2. Every A-R and B-R repair maps to the text in §3.
3. D1–D4 appear exactly as in §2 and are applied consistently.
4. The M33.2 amendments are additive, preserve the prior text, and match D2 and the G1/G3 intent.
5. No stale contradiction survives unmarked for:
   - ExperienceStore reference learning;
   - Graphify document/email retrieval;
   - model-created TENTATIVE;
   - explicit-model `SUPPRESS`;
   - template-only fallback;
   - TOOL_CATALOG tiers;
   - 20/27;
   - "correction is always a new request";
   - duplicate routers;
   - durable learning before URI-Memory.
6. No production code, frozen artifact, or research code changed.
7. Plan A R2.11 invents no existing field (the `depends_on` / provenance source is marked planned).

### 7a. RG-0R focused re-audit handoff (completed, verdict `RG_0R_ACCEPTED`)

The focused re-auditor should verify at least the following from repository evidence alone:
1. Plan A R3.1: `CHOOSE_ATTRIBUTE` has a complete logical contract (option type, render request with a separate `a*` namespace, `ATTRIBUTE` payload without `candidate_id`, validation, re-resolution transition, escape path). An attribute selection can never directly produce `CONFIRMED`.
2. Plan A R3.2: no redo is reachable before BindingService rebinds to `CONFIRMED(Y)`. BindingService admissible states are explicit. An approval for X never authorizes Y. The edited-result invariant and the S11 dependency are stated.
3. Plan A R3.3 and audit COR-5: `candidate_scores` are described as deterministic diagnostic scores, not calibrated confidence. No learned ranking is added to frozen RAR.
4. Plan B R2 and audit COR-6: the existing `RARQuery` is called the RAR-facing projection. The future evidence envelope is not represented as implemented. No gateway design goes beyond the conceptual boundary.
5. No stale unmarked contradiction survives on these four topics. D1 acceptance no longer appears unresolved.
6. The protected artifacts in §6 are unchanged. No code, fixture, or frozen evidence changed.

**Known limitation (G0 pass, retained):** this repair pass was performed by Claude, which also authored Plan A and the cross-plan audit. Independence of RG-0 is therefore required. The RG-0 bounded repair was also performed by Claude, so RG-0R must likewise be performed by another agent.
