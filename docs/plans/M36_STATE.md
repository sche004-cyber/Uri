## Decisions

| ID | Date | Decision | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| D4-R1 | 2026-09-28 | History yes, learning no. Durable task/outcome/correction history may feed cross-session reference resolution as grounded candidates and factual recency. Learned preference or tie-break weights, frequency preference, and repetition-based promotion stay deferred (S9). Memory never binds. | Direct User answer in the M36 planning session |
| D-A (OD-1), OD-2, OD-3, OD-4, OD-5, VG-1, LF-1 | 2026-09-28 | External execution harness rulings, Brain provider/transport neutrality, workspace and permission defaults, harness contract placement, viability gate, local-first principle. Full text in `docs/governance/URI_STATE.yaml` → `architecture_decisions` and `docs/plans/PAPERCLIP_URI_ARCHITECTURE_RECONNAISSANCE.md` §24. No structural change to M36 (plan §16.1). | Direct User instruction, 2026-09-28 |
| M36-A1-H1 | 2026-09-28 | `harness_run_ref` DEFERRED with name and constraints reserved (plan §16.2): lineage-only, non-authoritative, loss-tolerant, never retrievable content; to be added only in a later schema version with a v1 reader. PG-M1 may instead accept the stated in-M36 fallback. | Claude Code (Architect), within the User's instruction to avoid unnecessary M36 expansion; subject to PG-M1 |

## Gates

| Gate | Requirement | Status |
|---|---|---|
| PG-M1 | Final focused N-1 FREE_INPUT/A4 re-check plus preservation of A2/A3 | PG_M1_ACCEPTED per User-supplied current planning state; separate final report unavailable |
| PG-M2 | Explicit User implementation authorization | GRANTED_BY_USER in current attached task package |
| Freeze | Plan §12 item 4 | OPEN — closing audit performed 2026-09-28 (REPAIRS_REQUIRED); F-1..F-6 and D-1 repaired; freeze requires User decision |

## History log

| Date | Actor | Transition | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-09-28 | Claude Code (Opus 5.5), Architect / Pre-Auditor | (none) → PLAN_DRAFTED_AWAITING_INDEPENDENT_PREAUDIT | Recovered Memory evidence across `_V1 uri_core/`, `_V1 uri_v1/`, plans, governance, and untracked harness-strategy research; bounded external research (Graphiti, MCP memory server, Letta, Mem0); User decision D4-R1 recorded; plan self-reviewed against its own acceptance criteria (plan §0, §15). Not auto-approved to implementation: the User limited this session to planning, and L4 is high-risk, so an independent pre-audit is required first. |
| 2026-09-28 | Claude Code (Opus 5.5), Architect | PLAN_DRAFTED_AWAITING_INDEPENDENT_PREAUDIT (unchanged); readiness marker added | Amendment A1 (plan §16): recorded the effect on M36 of the User's harness rulings (D-A/OD-1…OD-5, VG-1, LF-1) after the Paperclip reconnaissance. No structural change. `harness_run_ref` deferred and reserved. Exit criterion E-6 added (already met by the §7.8 design). Edge-planning implications recorded. PG-M1 audit brief written. PG-M1 itself not performed (author is not independent). |
| 2026-09-28 | Claude Code (Opus 5.5), fresh independent session | PG_M1_ACCEPTED_WITH_BOUNDED_REPAIRS | Report above finds eleven required planning defects F-1…F-11 / R-1…R-11. No implementation authority. harness_run_ref deferral accepted. |
| 2026-09-28 | Codex, User-authorized bounded planning-repair implementer | PLAN_DRAFTED_AWAITING_INDEPENDENT_PREAUDIT → PLAN_A2_REPAIRED_AWAITING_PG_M1_FOCUSED_RECHECK | Additive A2 (§17) repairs F-1…F-11, marks conflicting draft text historical/superseded, adds Q-A2-1…Q-A2-11 and performs focused self-review only. Memory boundary unchanged; PG-M2 remains blocked. Prior A1 claim “E-6 already met” is historical: conditional on future OD-3 representation, not independently demonstrated. Edge sufficiency unverified until an Edge plan exists. |

## A2 handoff

Historical A2 handoff; superseded by the A3 handoff below. Its validation/history remains evidence for the A2 commit.

- Exact repair interpretation, normative specification and qualification mapping: plan §17.
- harness_run_ref: DEFERRED under unchanged §16.2 reserved constraints; no fake harness fixtures.
- Open: independent focused PG-M1 re-check; future implementation/qualification/live evidence; advisory F-12…F-18 and disclosed Edge/Harness sufficiency limitations. F-19 overstatements are marked historical, not independently re-audited.
- Recommended focused re-check prompt: plan §17.14. Stop at M36_A2_READY_FOR_PG_M1_FOCUSED_RECHECK; no PG-M2 request.

## A2 planning validation — 2026-09-28

| Check | Observed result |
|---|---|
| Governance validator | VALID; no DCL violations |
| Existing governance and selected frozen regression suites | 83 passed (37 governance plus 46 S1 governance/parity, S7 events, S11 versions and closing-audit tests) |
| Frozen hash checker | ok=True; changed=[]; 8 S4 and 24 LF anchors |
| Frozen scope diff | No tracked uri_v1/uri_core code, tests, scripts or fixtures differ from 291c9daa48435200c4b56857d0e3bc630016e82a |
| A2 structure/state consistency | 11 repair sections and 11 qualification rows present; state/status/gates consistent; non-M36 governance unchanged |
| A2-scoped git diff --check | Clean for the five modified planning/governance/handoff files |
| Repository-wide git diff --check | Existing SKILL.md trailing whitespace at lines 581/582 only; file preserved untouched |
| Dirty-worktree preservation | All 220 pre-existing dirty/untracked individual files retain their baseline hashes, including the independent audit report; only the five authorized documentation files modified |

No Memory implementation tests, new test files, full architecture audit or live Memory acceptance are claimed. The independent report is retained unchanged as M36 audit evidence alongside the bounded documentation commit; unrelated research is excluded. Commit identity is reported by the repairer after creation.

## A3 history and handoff — 2026-09-28

| Actor / stage | Transition / finding |
|---|---|
| Independent focused A2 reviewer, supplied report | PG_M1_ACCEPTED_WITH_BOUNDED_REPAIRS: all F-1…F-11 hold; N-1 is the sole required remaining repair. Report preserved above; earlier audit history unchanged |
| Codex, User-authorized bounded planning-repair implementer | PLAN_A2_REPAIRED_AWAITING_PG_M1_FOCUSED_RECHECK → PLAN_A3_REPAIRED_AWAITING_FINAL_PG_M1_FOCUSED_RECHECK. Verified frozen certainty paths with model-origin expressions; A3 requires URI-adapter raw-turn grounding before exact title/ID projection. Exact titles also require unchanged A2 collision completeness |

- Scope: N-1 only, documentation/governance and qualification specification; all original repairs retained.
- Qualification: Q-A3-1 A–G, including model filename/ID negatives, explicit typed filename/ID controls, duplicate ambiguity and invalid provenance.
- Source IDs remain in the context package. Model copying is non-authoritative. No Memory boundary or accepted architecture-decision change.
- Open: final independent focused N-1/A3 re-check; future implementation/qualification. PG-M1 and PG-M2 remain blocked.
- Advisories A-1…A-4 retained without repair: Windows recall constant, multi-slot hardening, lock contention and full-root scan usability. F-12…F-18 remain disclosed.
- harness_run_ref remains DEFERRED; Edge sufficiency remains unverified; E-6 remains conditional on OD-3.
- Exact final re-check prompt: plan §18.5. Stop at M36_A3_READY_FOR_FINAL_PG_M1_FOCUSED_RECHECK; do not begin/request PG-M2.

## A3 planning validation — 2026-09-28

| Check | Observed result |
|---|---|
| N-1 read-only reproduction before editing | Existing wire normalizer preserved model expressions; frozen RAR/S1 confirmed both absent-from-raw exact title and copied ID. Raw phrase control was HEURISTIC/PENDING; duplicate title was AMBIGUOUS |
| Governance validator | VALID; no DCL violations |
| Relevant governance and selected frozen regression tests | 83 passed (37 governance plus 46 selected frozen tests) |
| Frozen anchor checker | ok=True; changed=[]; 8 S4 and 24 LF anchors |
| Frozen/code/test/fixture scope | No tracked uri_v1/uri_core/tests/scripts/fixtures differences from frozen 291c9daa48435200c4b56857d0e3bc630016e82a |
| Focused plan consistency | Original A2 body and all Q-A2 rows preserved except one additive notice; A1/rulings and non-M36 governance unchanged; prior corrections preserved; Q-A3-1 A–G present; state/gates consistent |
| Audit evidence | Focused report copy SHA-256 matches supplied attachment: 23641d98b6c042a97c428d4f53ae9841027bbd17de328a5769230513b6083d91; original PG-M1 report unchanged |
| A3-scoped whitespace | Clean for modified A3 documentation; full commit checked before creation |
| Repository-wide git diff --check | Existing SKILL.md trailing whitespace at lines 581/582 only, preserved |
| Dirty-worktree preservation | All 219 pre-existing dirty/untracked individual files retain their baseline hashes; no unrelated files included |

Q-A3-1 is future implementation qualification, not a claim that Memory was implemented or live-verified. Evidence qualification for the untracked LFM research decoder is in plan §18.1. Final independent PG-M1 acceptance remains pending.


## A4 history and handoff — 2026-09-28

Latest focused finding supplied in the User's A4 instruction (no separate report file located): PG_M1_ACCEPTED_WITH_BOUNDED_REPAIRS; all A2 repairs hold; A3 initial projection path accepted; sole remaining blocker N-1 clarification FREE_INPUT. The A3 handoff/status above is historical; plan §19.5 is now the exact final re-check prompt.

Codex, explicitly authorized bounded planning-repair implementer: PLAN_A3_REPAIRED_AWAITING_FINAL_PG_M1_FOCUSED_RECHECK → PLAN_A4_REPAIRED_AWAITING_FINAL_PG_M1_FOCUSED_RECHECK. Plan §19 requires current trusted raw-answer grounding before every FREE_INPUT respond() call, extends Q-A3-1 with H1/H2 negative and H3 positive cases, and preserves A2/A3. Baseline: 9a01a4e72b4b3862fb047f3618aad7cac7a4c44e. Frozen baseline: 291c9daa48435200c4b56857d0e3bc630016e82a.

PG-M1 still awaits final focused acceptance; PG-M2 remains blocked and must not be begun/requested. Memory remains NOT_STARTED. D-A, OD-2…OD-5, VG-1, LF-1, harness_run_ref deferral and disclosed Edge limitations remain unchanged; no advisory repairs. The User authorizes one bounded docs/governance commit, no push. Readiness: M36_A4_READY_FOR_FINAL_PG_M1_RECHECK.


## A4 planning validation — 2026-09-28

| Check | Observed result |
|---|---|
| Defect reproduction | Frozen real pending-round FREE_INPUT → RAR → authority → binding confirmed both ungrounded filename/ID examples; genuine typed controls also confirmed. Contract-boundary evidence only; details and empty-scope control in plan §19.1 |
| Governance validator | `python scripts/governance/uri_state_validator.py`: VALID; no DCL violations |
| Relevant governance tests | `python -m pytest tests/governance -q`: 37 passed |
| Frozen anchor checker | `python scripts/m33_3_r_anchors.py`: ok=True, changed=[], 8 S4 and 24 LF anchors |
| Frozen/code/test diff check | No tracked differences from 291c9daa48435200c4b56857d0e3bc630016e82a in uri_v1, uri_core, uri_ui, tests, scripts, fixtures or root test*.py |
| Preservation consistency | Entire pre-A4 plan body from §0 onward unchanged, including all A2/A3 rules and qualification rows; non-M36 parsed governance/decisions and prior corrections unchanged; both independent report files unchanged |
| Focused certainty-path consistency | Pre-call current-answer grounding covers every FREE_INPUT: first/later answers, retry, fallback/rebuild, attribute-round free text and Change/rebind. No text rewrite may bypass via synthetic selection or new exact query; actual explicit selection retains frozen validation. H1–H3 and all required state clauses present |
| Whitespace | A4-scoped git diff --check clean; repository-wide check reports only pre-existing SKILL.md trailing whitespace at lines 581/582, preserved untouched |
| Dirty-worktree preservation | All 219 pre-existing dirty/untracked individual files retain their baseline hashes; only five authorized documentation/governance/handoff files changed |

These are planning checks, not independent PG-M1 acceptance or future H/Memory live qualification. One bounded docs/governance commit is authorized; its hash is returned after creation. No push.

## Implementation handoff — 2026-09-28

Direct User implementation package authorized all nine waves and supplies PG_M1_ACCEPTED/PG_M2. No separate final A4 audit report was supplied or found; this is recorded as supplied authority, not an independently obtained verdict. Earlier planning handoffs above are historical.

State: M36_IMPLEMENTED_VERIFICATION_READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_AUDIT. Implementation and self-qualification evidence: [M36 implementation report](M36_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md), [qualification matrix](M36_QUALIFICATION_MATRIX.md), machine telemetry and JUnit artifacts listed there. No independent closing audit, frozen promotion, INT-* event, S13/Brain/production/UI integration, release or push. Next action: a separate independent closing-audit session using the exact report prompt.

## Closing audit and bounded repair — 2026-09-28

| Actor / stage | Transition / finding |
|---|---|
| Claude, independent closing auditor (not the implementer) | M36_IMPLEMENTED_VERIFICATION_READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_AUDIT → REPAIRS_REQUIRED. Audited `be4451c` on a clean Linux clone and the User's Windows `_V1` checkout. Frozen boundary, anchors, governance and test counts reproduced; six code findings F-1..F-6 and docs finding D-1. Report: [M36_INDEPENDENT_CLOSING_AUDIT_REPORT.md](M36_INDEPENDENT_CLOSING_AUDIT_REPORT.md). |
| Claude, same session, User-authorized bounded repairer | REPAIRS_REQUIRED → M36_AUDIT_REPAIRED_AWAITING_FREEZE_DECISION. Repairs in `uri_v1/memory/` only; regression tests in `tests/test_m36_memory_audit_repairs.py`; three negation forms added to the predeclared battery (thresholds unchanged); D-1 restored `pg_m1_verdict` and appended `pg_m1_final_verdict`. Re-verification evidence: [M36_REPAIR_VERIFICATION.md](M36_REPAIR_VERIFICATION.md). The re-verification was performed by the session that made the repairs and is therefore not an independent audit. Freeze not authorized. |
