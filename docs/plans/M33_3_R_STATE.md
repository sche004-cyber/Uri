# M33.3-R — State

**Current state (2026-09-28): `CLOSED_FROZEN`.** Independent closing verdict:
`ACCEPT_WITH_DOCUMENTED_LIMITATIONS`, under the User's one-session audit,
bounded-repair, requalification and release authorization. Evidence:
`docs/plans/M33_3_R_INDEPENDENT_CLOSING_AUDIT_REPORT.md`.

S1 (including corrected S1-A1), S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8, S10, S11 and
S12 are accepted/frozen within their documented offline/fixture-backed scope.
S9 is excluded and re-homed to URI-Memory/D4; S13 is excluded and requires a
future INT-* authorization. M33.3 is complete within this explicit boundary.
No model wording tier qualified; template is primary. S8 has one qualified
route; S12 remains fixture-only. No production adoption, model/residency-policy
freeze, research promotion, or next-slice authorization is created.

Final clean LF regression: 3,261 passed, 9 baseline failures, 66 skipped, 218 subtests passed; no new failures.
Flutter 204 passed; S12 analysis clean; one baseline full-app analyzer INFO.
Historical records below remain evidence of their dates, not current authority.

## Historical implementer record (2026-09-27)

**Current state:** `M33_3_R_IMPLEMENTATION_CANDIDATE_AWAITING_INDEPENDENT_CLOSING_AUDIT` (all authorized stages complete at implementer level; integrated qualification passed; report `docs/plans/M33_3_R_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md`). M33.3 is NOT closed or frozen.
**State history:** `M33_3_R_IN_PROGRESS` -> `M33_3_R_S5_USER_TOUCHPOINT_PENDING` -> `M33_3_R_S5_GATE_FROZEN` -> `M33_3_R_S5_FINAL_REQUALIFICATION_RUNNING` -> `M33_3_R_IMPLEMENTATION_CANDIDATE_AWAITING_INDEPENDENT_CLOSING_AUDIT`.
**Plan:** `docs/plans/M33_3_R_CONTINUOUS_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`. **Canonical state:** `docs/governance/URI_STATE.yaml` (`M33.3` status `M33_3_R_IN_PROGRESS`).
**Authority:** User task package "URI M33.3-R — Continuous Remaining-Milestone Execution" (2026-09-27).
**Implementer:** Claude (Opus 5.5). Implementer testing and self-review are not the independent closing audit.

## 1. Baseline

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Worktree | `C:\Users\cheta\Development\Uri\_V1` |
| Branch | `m35-uri-v1-parallel-architecture` |
| Starting HEAD | `c2f583909a3d13d295c997c038b0ac724f787755` (= `origin`, 0 ahead / 0 behind, verified 2026-09-27) |
| Unrelated work | 1 modified tracked file (`SKILL.md`) and ~150 untracked research files/dirs (M35 A2.x scripts, `uri_v1/{app,arn,context,edge,execution,intelligence,recovery,safety}`, `scratch/`, reports). Preserved; never staged. |
| Clean-baseline regression | fresh detached checkout of `c2f5839`: 3146 passed, 14 failed, 66 skipped, 218 subtests (see §7) |

## 2. Scope and exclusions

- **Authorized:** S5, S6, S7, S8, S10, S11, S12.
- **Excluded:** S9 (re-homed to URI-Memory / D4), S13 (separate future INT-* gated integration). S12 is fixture-backed until S13.
- **Never in this milestone:** `/ask` or agent-loop wiring, URI-RAR adoption, INT-* events, research promotion, changes to frozen S1–S4 artifacts.
- **Closure boundary (User decision):** M33.3 closes after S5, S6, S7, S8, S10, S11, S12 and one independent closing audit.

## 3. Governance preparation

- **GD-1:** `active_continuation.next_slice_authorized` was `false` while `later_slice_implementation_authorized` was `true`. Both now `true`, scoped to S5/S6/S7/S8/S10/S11/S12 (`later_slice_authorized_scope`), with S9/S13 listed as excluded. History preserved in `next_slice_authorization_note`.
- **GD-2:** the M33.3 `human_readable_pointer.canonical_status_here` still said `S3_CLOSED_FROZEN`; corrected to `M33_3_R_IN_PROGRESS` with `canonical_status_history` recording the stale value.
- **GD-3:** `m33_3_r_rar_hash_pins` records the current active RAR hash `4db77566…` (pinned by all M33.3-R work via `scripts/m33_3_r_anchors.py`) and the historical Batch A/A9 hash `e02af25b…` (history only, not re-pinned).
- Validator: `python scripts/governance/uri_state_validator.py` → VALID after the repair.

## 4. Protected anchors

`scripts/m33_3_r_anchors.py` verifies the 8 frozen S4 replay anchors (raw bytes, including the current RAR hash) and 24 frozen S1/S2/S3/S4 code and fixture files (LF-normalized SHA-256 recorded at baseline). Every M33.3-R runner calls `require_anchors()` before and after it runs.

## 6. User touchpoint (answered 2026-09-27, recorded exactly)

Asked through the session question tool after the exploratory report and blind sheet were delivered.

| Question | User answer |
|---|---|
| Validator decision (frozen S1 validator rejects ordinary words) | **Reopen S1 allowlist** — "Authorize a bounded S1 validator allowlist amendment inside M33.3-R. S1 and S3 need requalification, and S5 is rerun after that." |
| Latency tolerance (warm p95, model wording) | **p95 ≤ 1.5 s** |
| Fallback tolerance (model tier qualification) | **≤ 25%** |
| Blind wording ratings | **Template is fine** — "Skip rating. Template wording is acceptable as primary. No noticeable-improvement gate is needed now." |

Consequences applied: amendment S1-A1 (bounded function-word allowlist widening; S1/S2/S3 requalified); threshold gate frozen with these values before the fresh final run; no noticeable-improvement gate; the blind sheet stays as unrated evidence.

## 7. Clean-baseline failures (c2f5839, fresh detached checkout, `core.autocrlf=true`)

14 failures before any M33.3-R change: S3 manifest portability, two S4 replay anchor tests, two M33.2 B2 corpus SHA-256 tests (these five compare raw-byte hashes that a CRLF checkout changes), plus `test_capability_directory` privacy, three M20 recovery/interpreter tests, two M20 semantic-interpreter tests, `test_orchestrator_session_workflow`, `test_usage_import_boundary` (orchestrator newline count), `test_workflow_restart_recovery`. They are recorded so the integrated qualification can separate clean-baseline failures from new ones.

## 8. M33.3 closure criteria

1. S5: frozen-required gates pass in the fresh final requalification; threshold gate frozen before that run and not weakened after it.
2. S6, S7, S10 (ledger + study), S11, S12, S8 qualified as in the plan §6.
3. Integrated qualification: full tracked regression with no new failures versus §7, protected anchors unchanged, governance validator VALID, `git diff --check` clean, production-scope check (no `/ask`/agent-loop wiring), S9/S13 not absorbed.
4. Candidate committed and pushed; local HEAD equals remote HEAD.
5. One independent closing audit by another model/session accepts the candidate. Only that audit may close/freeze M33.3.

## 9. Per-slice status (implementer level; none is independently audited)

| Slice | Status |
|---|---|
| S1 | `CLOSED_FROZEN`, reopened only for amendment S1-A1 (User decision), requalified; audit of S1-A1 pending in the closing audit |
| S2 | `CLOSED_FROZEN` (unchanged) |
| S3 | `CLOSED_FROZEN` (unchanged; requalified 82/82 after S1-A1) |
| S4 | `CLOSED_FROZEN` (unchanged; offline experiment only) |
| S5 | `IMPLEMENTED_REQUALIFIED_AWAITING_INDEPENDENT_AUDIT` (template-only qualified routes) |
| S6 | `IMPLEMENTED_QUALIFIED_AWAITING_INDEPENDENT_AUDIT` |
| S7 | `IMPLEMENTED_QUALIFIED_AWAITING_INDEPENDENT_AUDIT` |
| S8 | `IMPLEMENTED_QUALIFIED_AWAITING_INDEPENDENT_AUDIT` (offline; degenerate on real routes) |
| S9 | `EXCLUDED` (re-homed to URI-Memory / D4) |
| S10 | `IMPLEMENTED_QUALIFIED_AWAITING_INDEPENDENT_AUDIT` |
| S11 | `IMPLEMENTED_QUALIFIED_AWAITING_INDEPENDENT_AUDIT` |
| S12 | `IMPLEMENTED_QUALIFIED_AWAITING_INDEPENDENT_AUDIT` (fixture-backed) |
| S13 | `EXCLUDED` (separate future INT-* milestone) |
| M33.3 | `M33_3_R_IMPLEMENTATION_CANDIDATE_AWAITING_INDEPENDENT_CLOSING_AUDIT` (not closed, not frozen) |
| Independent closing audit | `NOT_STARTED` — must be performed by another model/session |
