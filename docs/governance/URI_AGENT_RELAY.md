# URI Agent Relay

Single canonical inter-agent handoff mailbox for URI development coordination.
All Claude <-> Antigravity <-> Codex milestone communication occurs through repository files.
Do NOT use agent-private logs or external directory scraping as communication channels.

**Canonical current-state authority note (added 2026-09-25, Development
Control Layer Normalization, additive):** canonical current development
state is defined by `docs/governance/URI_STATE.yaml`. The entries below are
historical/handoff context and must not override canonical state. Where
this file and `URI_STATE.yaml` conflict on what is current, `URI_STATE.yaml`
wins unless a later, formally accepted governance artifact explicitly
supersedes it.

## CURRENT HANDOFF (M33.3 Batch A — FROZEN, ACCEPT_WITH_DOCUMENTED_LIMITATIONS)

**FROM:**
Claude Sonnet 5 (bounded freeze implementer, by direct User instruction `FREEZE_AND_COMMIT_M33_3_BATCH_A`)

**TO:**
Whoever plans the next M33.3 workstream (ARN architecture / <=1B clarification text generator, planning only)

**MILESTONE:**
M33.3 — Edge Intelligence Qualification & Integration, Batch A (`M33.3-A`)

**HANDOFF TYPE:**
FREEZE — CLOSED AS STAGE A READINESS EVIDENCE

**STATUS:**
`BATCH_A_FROZEN_ACCEPTED_WITH_LIMITATIONS`. Independent R4 re-audit verdict `ACCEPT_WITH_DOCUMENTED_LIMITATIONS`.

**AUTHORITATIVE ARTIFACTS:**
- `docs/plans/M33_3_BATCH_A_R4_INDEPENDENT_REAUDIT_REPORT.md` (the independent verdict, preserved as a durable artifact for the first time)
- `docs/plans/M33_3_BATCH_A_R4_REPAIR_REPORT.md`, `_R3_`, `_R2_`, and the original `M33_3_BATCH_A_REPAIR_REPORT.md` (R1), `M33_3_BATCH_A_COMPLETION_REPORT.md` (original submission)
- `docs/plans/M33_3_BATCH_A_AGGREGATES.json`, `_TELEMETRY.json` (final; only a `coverage_rule` metadata string changed at freeze, no score changed)

**SUMMARY:**
Frozen as Stage A readiness / methodology evidence only. No Edge candidate
is qualified; no Stage B, `INT-*`, or ARN implementation is authorized.
Accepted Main-Brain-avoidance result: verified 0, potential 0, unverified
22. Safety gates G-S1 `0/7/1/1`, G-S2 `0/12/0/3`, G-S3 `0/20/0/0`, G-S4 `0`.
G-R1..G-R5 pass. The historical text-gap limitation for 78 already-retained
multi-step rows is preserved unresolved and unsoftened: a fresh, separately
authorized run would be required for a stronger historical claim. Next
authorized action is planning only, for ARN architecture and a <=1B
clarification text generator — not implementation.

## PARALLEL LINE HANDOFF (uri-agent working tree, preserved 2026-10-01 on preserve/running-app-2026-10-01; M31 — URI HYBRID UI LIVE ACCEPTANCE REMEDIATION TO CODEX)

**FROM:**
Antigravity (Coordinator / Harness)

**TO:**
Codex

**MILESTONE:**
M31 — URI Hybrid UI (Post-Live Acceptance Remediation Pass)

**HANDOFF TYPE:**
IMPLEMENTATION

**STATUS:**
IMPLEMENTING

**AUTHORITATIVE ARTIFACTS:**
- docs/plans/CODEX_HYBRID_UI_REPAIR_TASK.txt
- temp_evidence/m31_visual_review/LIVE_ACCEPTANCE_REMEDIATION_REPORT.md
- temp_evidence/m31_visual_review/m31_working_tree.patch

- docs/plans/M33_2_BATCH_B4_COMPLETION_REPORT.md
- docs/plans/ARN_1_COMPLETION_REPORT.md
- docs/governance/URI_ACTIVE_MILESTONE.md

**SUMMARY:**
Antigravity has packaged the working-tree diff, test suites, and primary evidence from the Live Acceptance Remediation pass (all 181 Flutter tests passing, all Python route/regression tests passing).
Per direct User instruction, implementation of the remaining 11 Live Acceptance Remediation items is delegated to Codex as the specialist coder.
Antigravity acts solely as coordinator/harness:
- Preserving current working tree and prior working repairs.
- Delegating task directive docs/plans/CODEX_HYBRID_UI_REPAIR_TASK.txt to Codex.
- Codex will inspect the uncommitted tree, resolve the 11 items, perform full regression, and produce POST_LIVE_CONSOLIDATED_REPAIR_REPORT.md.
- Target state: VERIFICATION_READY. No commit, no push, no declaration of VERIFIED.

## PREVIOUS HANDOFF (M33.3 Batch A — Bounded Repair R4 — VERIFICATION_READY_FOR_M33_3_A_R4_REAUDIT)

**FROM:**
Claude Sonnet 5 (bounded repair implementer, by direct User instruction `BOUNDED_M33_3_A_REPAIR_R4`)

**TO:**
Independent auditor (an agent other than Claude, or the User)

**MILESTONE:**
M33.3 — Edge Intelligence Qualification & Integration, Batch A (`M33.3-A`)

**HANDOFF TYPE:**
BOUNDED REPAIR R4 COMPLETE — R4 RE-AUDIT REQUEST

**STATUS:**
`VERIFICATION_READY_FOR_M33_3_A_R4_REAUDIT`. Not accepted, not frozen. Stage B not authorized.

**AUTHORITATIVE ARTIFACTS:**
- `docs/plans/M33_3_BATCH_A_R4_REPAIR_REPORT.md`
- `docs/plans/M33_3_BATCH_A_AGGREGATES.json`, `_TELEMETRY.json` (regenerated; no value changes)

**SUMMARY:**
Responds to independent R3 re-audit (`REPAIR_REQUIRED`). A 2,000-character
truncation on retained model text silently dropped safety-relevant content
past that cutoff, defeating R3's own per-step retention fix. Removed the
truncation; text is now retained in full. Added a test that drives the real
`required_coverage()`/quote-union pipeline directly against long,
error-terminated text, per R3's separate coverage-path critique, plus a test
confirming no currently retained row was ever near the old cutoff. Offline
rescore: zero change to any published number. The R3-disclosed residual
(no per-step history for 78 already-retained multi-step rows) remains
unresolved; a future rerun would be needed to close it.

## PREVIOUS HANDOFF (M33.3 Batch A — Bounded Repair R3 — VERIFICATION_READY_FOR_M33_3_A_R3_REAUDIT)

**FROM:**
Claude Sonnet 5 (bounded repair implementer, by direct User instruction `BOUNDED_M33_3_A_REPAIR_R3`)

**TO:**
Independent auditor (an agent other than Claude, or the User)

**MILESTONE:**
M33.3 — Edge Intelligence Qualification & Integration, Batch A (`M33.3-A`)

**HANDOFF TYPE:**
BOUNDED REPAIR R3 COMPLETE — R3 RE-AUDIT REQUEST

**STATUS:**
`VERIFICATION_READY_FOR_M33_3_A_R3_REAUDIT`. Not accepted, not frozen. Stage B not authorized.

**AUTHORITATIVE ARTIFACTS:**
- `docs/plans/M33_3_BATCH_A_R3_REPAIR_REPORT.md`
- `docs/plans/M33_3_BATCH_A_R2_TRANSCRIPT_ADJUDICATIONS.json` (rebuilt, same 67 entries)
- `docs/plans/M33_3_BATCH_A_AGGREGATES.json`, `_TELEMETRY.json` (regenerated; no value changes)

**SUMMARY:**
Responds to the first genuinely independent audit this batch received
(verdict `REPAIR_REQUIRED`). Fixed: adjudication coverage no longer skips a
row merely because it errored; the harness now retains every step's own
text instead of one overwritable `final_text`. Ten new end-to-end tests
(mocked HTTP layer, full harness -> coverage -> scorer path) prove
persistence across a continued step and all three error classes, plus a
negative control. Offline rescore: zero change to any published number,
since no currently retained row exercises the newly-covered case. Disclosed,
not resolved: the 78 already-retained multi-step rows cannot be
retroactively checked for a lost mid-trace commitment, since the pre-fix
harness never stored per-step text.

## PREVIOUS HANDOFF (M33.3 Batch A — Bounded Repair R2 — VERIFICATION_READY_FOR_M33_3_A_R2_REAUDIT)

**FROM:**
Claude Opus 5.5 (bounded repair implementer, by direct User instruction `BOUNDED_M33_3_A_REPAIR_R2`)

**TO:**
Independent auditor (an agent other than Claude, or the User)

**MILESTONE:**
M33.3 — Edge Intelligence Qualification & Integration, Batch A (`M33.3-A`)

**HANDOFF TYPE:**
BOUNDED REPAIR R2 COMPLETE — R2 RE-AUDIT REQUEST

**STATUS:**
`VERIFICATION_READY_FOR_M33_3_A_R2_REAUDIT`. Not accepted, not frozen. Stage B not authorized.

**AUTHORITATIVE ARTIFACTS:**
- `docs/plans/M33_3_BATCH_A_R2_REPAIR_REPORT.md`
- `docs/plans/M33_3_BATCH_A_R2_TRANSCRIPT_ADJUDICATIONS.json` (implementer-authored, NOT independent — review every entry)
- `docs/plans/M33_3_BATCH_A_AGGREGATES.json`, `_TELEMETRY.json` (current, post-R2)

**SUMMARY:**
Offline rescore of the retained 240 rows; no provider inference. Final-text
commitments are now unsafe and monotonic across later errors (`RWB-006`,
`RWB-045`, `RWB-104`, `RWB-062`); clarification correctness and escalation
reporting come from quote-backed adjudication; proposal and completion are
separate (Needle completions 14 → 0); verified Main-Brain avoidance is 0
(was 19; 22 unverified); per-row artifact provenance on every published row
(G-R5 PASS). Historical deltas remain reconstructed, not authenticated.

## PREVIOUS HANDOFF (M33.3 Batch A — Bounded Repair — VERIFICATION_READY_FOR_M33_3_A_REAUDIT)

**FROM:**
Claude Sonnet 5 (bounded repair implementer for this batch, by direct User instruction)

**TO:**
Independent auditor (an agent other than Claude, or the User)

**MILESTONE:**
M33.3 — Edge Intelligence Qualification & Integration, Batch A (`M33.3-A`)

**HANDOFF TYPE:**
BOUNDED REPAIR COMPLETE — RE-AUDIT REQUEST

**STATUS:**
`VERIFICATION_READY_FOR_M33_3_A_REAUDIT`. Not accepted.

**AUTHORITATIVE ARTIFACTS:**
- `docs/plans/M33_3_BATCH_A_REPAIR_REPORT.md` (this repair: 7 findings addressed, before/after deltas, no provider reruns)
- `docs/plans/M33_3_BATCH_A_COMPLETION_REPORT.md` (original submission, preserved unedited — its numeric claims are superseded by the repair report, not rewritten)
- `docs/plans/M33_3_BATCH_A_AGGREGATES.json`, `_TELEMETRY.json` (current, post-repair)
- `docs/plans/M33_3_BATCH_A_PRE_REPAIR_AGGREGATES.json`, `_PRE_REPAIR_TELEMETRY.json` (historical, pre-repair)
- `docs/plans/M33_3_BATCH_A_CONTRACT_MAPPING.md`
- `fixtures/m33_3_batch_a/battery.json` (LF SHA-256 `06d0dfff…c3fa`, unchanged)

**SUMMARY:**
No durable independent-audit artifact for M33.3-A exists in this repository
(disclosed gap, repair report §0); the seven `REPAIR_REQUIRED` findings this
repair addresses were each independently re-verified against retained raw
evidence before being fixed (most notably, the "19 confirmation-gated rows
mislabeled complete" finding was independently recomputed and matched
exactly). Repairs made, offline, from retained raw provider outputs only —
zero provider reruns: (1) G-S1 no longer conflates tool-selection, safety, and
ask/clarification — a legitimate, non-prohibited read-only investigation
before asking is no longer automatically unsafe; (2) safety violations are now
monotonic across a later error/timeout; (3) a new `CORRECT_PROPOSAL_PENDING_
CONFIRMATION` outcome separates a correct confirmation-gated proposal from
literal task completion; (4) the unnecessary-Main-Brain metric now reports
verified/potential/unverified separately instead of one number; (5) per-
provider artifact hash provenance corrected (Needle's weight hash recovered
retroactively from the unchanged cache file; the 9B's WP-A0 hash now actually
wired into rows); (6) G-R3 wording split into two distinct invariants instead
of one blanket PASS; (7) one stale "not started" governance field corrected.
Battery, protected M33.2/A9 artifacts, and the frozen plans are unchanged.
Claude planned, implemented, and repaired this batch, so Claude must not
perform the re-audit. No Stage B, no `INT-*`, no promotion.

**SUMMARY:**
First executable M33.3 batch. Stage A isolated readiness only: freeze the
real-workload battery, build the scorer, measure reference baselines, and
characterize the unmodified deterministic path; write a documentary mapping
to the M33.2 Edge contracts; record Rung 1 eligibility. No `uri_core`
import, no change under `uri_core/`, `uri_v1/`, or `uri_ui/`, no model
download, no real side effects, no production integration, no `INT-*`
event, no promotion. Stage B cannot start directly after this batch. The
implementation task package must quote the seven routing constraints in
the state file verbatim.

**ROUTING SUBSTITUTION DIRECTIVE:**
Codex quota is currently unavailable. Implementation routing for A2.8J is substituted to Claude Sonnet as preferred implementer (Gemini 3.8 as fallback). Codex is prohibited; Opus is prohibited unless a genuine blocker arises. The accepted plan, scope, acceptance criteria, architecture, and experimental design remain strictly frozen. The implementer must execute M35_URIV1_A2_8J_RAR_SAFE_QUALIFICATION_PLAN.md exactly as frozen and stop at VERIFICATION_READY. No commit or push.

**CLOSURE NOTE (added 2026-09-25, Post-A9 governance-state reconciliation):**
The `IMPLEMENTING` status and routing directive above are historical —
preserved as-is, not live. A2.8J actually closed as `COMPLETE` (bounded
re-audit verdict `ACCEPTED`; experimental result accepted, not a
promotion of RAR-SAFE or of S3) at commit `247265f` (M35 A2.8J: close
RAR-SAFE qualification), closure authorized by the User on 2026-09-24,
pushed successfully. See `docs/plans/M35_URIV1_A2_8J_STATE.md` §Release
and `docs/plans/M35_URIV1_A2_8J_BOUNDED_REAUDIT.md`. This entry was left
without a resolution annotation when commit `49a801f` (A9 closure)
introduced it into the relay; no prior relay commit ever recorded this
handoff. Do not treat this entry as an open/active task.

## PREVIOUS HANDOFF (CLOSED: ARN.1 DETERMINISTIC NARROWING CORE — VERIFIED)

**FROM:**
Gemini (Independent Final Auditor)

**TO:**
User / Antigravity

**MILESTONE:**
ARN.1 — Adaptive Retrieval Narrowing & Task Recovery: Batch ARN.1 — Deterministic Narrowing Core

**HANDOFF TYPE:**
CLOSURE + MILESTONE PAUSE

**STATUS:**
CLOSED / VERIFIED

**AUTHORITATIVE ARTIFACTS:**
- docs/plans/ARN_ADAPTIVE_RETRIEVAL_NARROWING_PLAN.md
- docs/plans/ARN_1_STATE.md
- docs/plans/ARN_1_COMPLETION_REPORT.md
- docs/governance/URI_ACTIVE_MILESTONE.md

**SUMMARY:**
Gemini performed the independent final audit of ARN.1 per direct User instruction. Verified:
1. `NOT_FOUND` empty result triggers recovery without raising; raw `execution.status == "not_found"` is preserved for auditability while envelope becomes `status: "recovery_required"`.
2. `EvidenceCategory` implements all 6 types; `EDGE_DEDUCTION` cannot be promoted to `VERIFIED_FACT` (`EvidencePromotionError` raised).
3. Candidate tracking, normalized repeated-search avoidance, reasoned elimination, and clue filtering work deterministically without loops.
4. Clarification recommendations provide axes and non-degenerate candidate groups without authoring question text (canonical Brain loop retains authoring authority).
5. Configurable cost ceilings enforce clean transition to `EXHAUSTED` with `termination_reason="cost_ceiling_reached"`.
6. Zero Graphify imports; operates cleanly in environments without `graphify-out/`.
7. Additive, task-local integration into `canonical_execution.py`, `turn_state.py`, and `decision_engine.py` with no authority regressions.
8. Deterministic core: 0 model calls, no new execution authority, no M31 UI, no ARN.2+ code.

Independently reproduced test evidence:
- Focused ARN.1: 10/10 passed.
- M33.2 predecessor: 60/60 passed.
- Core orchestration/turn/execution: 130 passed, 13 subtests passed.
- Full regression: 2,259 passed, 16 failed (10 historical baseline, 6 Ollama environment-specific, 0 ARN.1 regressions).

Verdict: ACCEPT — VERIFIED / CLOSED.

**DIRECTIVE / NEXT AUTHORIZED DIRECTION:**
ARN milestone is PAUSED after ARN.1. Do NOT start ARN.2. Do NOT implement M31. Do NOT use Claude/Codex.
Next authorized direction: **Resume M31 Hybrid UI after ARN.1 closure**.

- test_m33_2_batch_b4_real_model_qualification.py
- docs/governance/URI_ACTIVE_MILESTONE.md

**SUMMARY:**
Codex has completed the implementation and qualification battery for M33.2 Batch B.4:
1. Real qualification of Needle 3 executed via proposal-only stdio bridge to `.venv-needle`:
   - 100% tool routing / competing-tool selection (8/8)
   - 100% structured record extraction (4/4)
   - 50% argument extraction (2/4 normalized exact)
   - ~101.6 MB provider peak RAM, ~159 ms p50 provider latency
   - Verdict: `RESIDENT` for reflex routing and structured extraction
2. Real qualification of SmolLM2-135M-Instruct Q3_K_M via portable user-space llama.cpp CPU runtime:
   - 0.625 language rubric score vs 0.333 baseline escalation
   - 0/4 exact answers; ~203.8 MB peak RSS; ~100 ms p50 latency
   - Verdict: `BYPASS / REDUNDANT` (quality gain does not justify memory footprint)
3. Real qualification of Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct Q4_K_M via portable user-space llama.cpp CPU runtime:
   - 50% bounded-reasoning accuracy (2/4) vs 0% baseline escalation
   - ~494 MB peak RSS; ~192 ms p50 latency
   - Substantive reasoning errors on constraints and set intersections
   - Installed Ollama controls (`qwen3.5:9b`, `gemma4:12b`) achieved 100% (4/4) on the same tier at 130–160 ms warm latency
   - Verdict: `BYPASS / REDUNDANT` (bypass to Main Brain on bounded reasoning)
4. Perception workers (STT, OCR, VLM) evaluated and truthfully recorded as `UNQUALIFIED / UNAVAILABLE` with documented constraints (missing published multi-file SHA-256 manifests, no portable Windows Tesseract binary, no <=1B VLM without heavy secondary framework).
5. Verification:
   - Required M33.2 suites: 60/60 passing (re-verified independently by Antigravity in 2.33s).
   - Full regression suite: 2,249 passed, 16 classified baseline failures (0 new attributable to B.4), 40 subtests passed.
   - All 32 `test_m19_office_readiness.py` tests passed cleanly.
   - Zero production routing, authority, or UI paths modified. Zero OS/privileged modifications. Zero network egress from `uri_core/core/edge/`.
   - Stopped at `VERIFICATION_READY` without commit or push.

**DIRECTIVE (original, Antigravity → Claude):**
Claude conducts the independent final audit of M33.2 Batch B.4, inspecting source diffs, qualification evidence, and test suites, returning ACCEPT or REPAIR REQUIRED, and executing release commit/push if verified.

**RESOLVED (Claude independent audit, 2026-09-20):**
Independently re-verified primary evidence rather than trusting the
completion report: recomputed SHA-256 for all three downloaded assets
directly against disk (all match); read the Needle bridge script and
confirmed proposal-only behavior and zero-egress posture; traced the
Configuration D 94.64 ms matrix-p50 figure to a real, disclosed cause;
independently reran the 60-test regression set (60/60 reproduced) and the
eleven files containing the reported 16 full-suite failures (exactly 16
reproduced, names matching 1:1, none touching a B.4-changed file). No
bounded defects found; no fix required. Full audit trail:
`docs/plans/M33_2_BATCH_B4_STATE.md`.

**REQUIRED NEXT ACTION:**
None for B.4 — CLOSED. Claude prepares the final M33.2 closure handoff next
(no Batch C, no M31 UI, no ARN implementation this session, per direct User
scope boundary).

3. Confined user-space storage in `uri_workspace/edge_models/` with SHA-256 verification and atomic rollback.
4. Loopback-only detection for Ollama and LM Studio.
5. Hardware probing (CPU/RAM/storage) with truthful unavailable GPU fallback.
6. Lazy lifecycle state management using frozen §10 vocabulary.
7. Telemetry foundation for developer log UI without chain-of-thought leakage.
8. No model promoted; no Batch C work started; no commit or push performed.

**RESOLVED (Claude independent audit, 2026-09-20):**
Re-inspected the plan, completion report, STATE, governance records, and
every source/test file in `uri_core/core/edge_lifecycle/` directly, and
re-executed evidence rather than trusting the report: reran the focused
9-test suite, all 45 predecessor tests, and the full-suite regression twice
(discarding one run that overlapped with the fix itself being applied
mid-run). Found and bounded-fixed one genuine defect: `detect_ollama_runtime`/
`detect_lmstudio_runtime` validated only the request URL as loopback but let
`requests.get` follow redirects by default, so a compromised loopback
service could redirect detection to an arbitrary external host. Fixed with
`allow_redirects=False` plus an explicit redirect rejection in `detection.py`
only; added one locking test (reproduced failing pre-fix, passing post-fix).
Focused suite: 10/10 (9 + 1 new). Clean full regression on the final code:
2,244 passed / 16 failed / 0 skipped / 40 subtests — the same 16 failures
independently reproduced by name (10 pre-existing baseline + 6 tests
hardcoded to the absent `qwen3:14b` model), none attributable to B.3.
Independently confirmed via a live `curl` probe of `127.0.0.1:11434/api/tags`
that Ollama is reachable with `qwen3.5:9b`/`gemma4:12b` installed and
`qwen3:14b` absent. No production routing/approval/dispatcher/registry/
orchestrator/server/credential/provider-catalogue/UI file was touched,
confirmed against the full working tree, not just the files Codex listed.
Separately recorded (not backdated, not produced by this automated report):
the User's own post-`VERIFICATION_READY` manual real-environment Needle
test (`cactus-needle` 3.0.2 / native engine 3.0.1) — real tool routing,
competing-tool selection, argument extraction, and structured record
extraction all PASS; peak RAM ~108-109 MB; `confidence = null` for the tuned
checkpoint; `extract()` returned `null` once while raw tool-schema
extraction passed; installed public API exposes no obvious audio/STT
surface, classified conservatively as installed-API/version mismatch, not
universal unsupported. **Verdict: VERIFIED — ACCEPT —
`INFRASTRUCTURE_VALIDATION_COMPLETE` / `REAL_MODEL_QUALIFICATION_PARTIAL`.**
No model promoted, no Batch C or M31 UI work authorized. Committed and
pushed at `d395c1c`.

**DIRECTIVE (original, Codex → Claude):**
Package the B.2 source diff, nine generated evidence bundles, focused 44/44
result, full regression result (2,232 passed / 10 failed / 7 skipped / 40
subtests; exact accepted failure set), and
`docs/plans/M33_2_BATCH_B2_COMPLETION_REPORT.md` for Claude's independent
audit. Fixture results are HARNESS VALIDATION only. Actual vision and
faster-whisper candidates are UNAVAILABLE; the installed Needle probe is
`NOT_SUPPORTED`. No candidate is promoted. No Batch C work is authorized.
Codex performed no commit or push.

**RESOLVED (Claude independent audit, 2026-09-20):**
Re-inspected the plan, completion report, STATE, governance records, and
every changed/new source/fixture/script/test file directly; re-executed
evidence rather than trusting the report (re-ran the focused suite, the
live runner, and two independent full-suite regressions). Found and
bounded-fixed one genuine defect: `probe_needle_audio()` classified an
un-importable needle/cactus_needle module as `NOT_SUPPORTED`, conflating
"package not installed" with the frozen plan's actual `NOT_SUPPORTED`
definition (an installed, introspected API confirmed to lack audio
capability). Added one additive `PACKAGE_NOT_INSTALLED` sub-state to
`NeedleAudioClassification` (speech.py only), one locking test, and
regenerated the Needle evidence artifact under the corrected classification
— confirmed reproducible. The fixture-overclaim concern raised alongside
it was checked directly against the report's actual text and found already
correctly hedged; no correction needed there. Focused suite re-run: 45/45
(44 original + 1 new). Live runner re-executed independently: all 9
evidence bundles regenerated, every fixture number reproduced bit-for-bit.
No production routing/approval/dispatcher/registry/orchestrator/server/
credential/UI code touched, confirmed against the full working tree.

**Disclosed, out-of-scope, non-blocking:** two independent full-suite runs
did not reproduce the claimed 10-failure shape. Pre-fix run: 12 failed /
2230 passed / 7 skipped / 40 subtests (2,249-item total). Post-fix run: 12
failed / 2231 passed / 7 skipped / 40 subtests (2,250-item total) —
identical failure names both times, pass count differing by exactly the 1
new locking test. The 10 originally-claimed failures reproduced exactly
both times. Two
additional failures — `test_m19_office_readiness.py::
GmailDraftAndDriveUploadSafetyTests::test_drive_upload_resolves_most_recent_session_file`
and `::test_no_credentials_reports_unavailable_honestly` — are caused by
real, gitignored `token.json`/`credentials.json` OAuth files present on
this machine (the tests assume no credentials; with real credentials the
Gmail/Drive tools genuinely succeed). Confirmed unrelated to B.2 (neither
file is touched by this batch) and unrelated to B.1 (B.1's own audit
reproduced the clean 10-failure shape earlier the same day, before this
credential state existed). Environment state, not a code regression; not
remediated under B.2's bounded-fix authority since it is entirely outside
B.2's scope. Full detail in `docs/plans/M33_2_BATCH_B2_COMPLETION_REPORT.md`
and `docs/plans/M33_2_BATCH_B2_STATE.md`.

**Verdict: ACCEPT.** No candidate promoted, no Batch C work authorized.
Claude performs the release commit/push per standing authority, then drafts
the M33.2 Batch B.3 planning handoff.

## PREVIOUS HANDOFF (CLOSED: M31 COMPLETE — CLAUDE VERIFIED)

**FROM:**
Antigravity

**TO:**
Claude

**MILESTONE:**
M31 — Model & Brain UX

**HANDOFF TYPE:**
AUDIT

**STATUS:**
COMPLETE — CLAUDE VERIFIED, RELEASED

**VERDICT:**

> **M31 — Model & Brain UX — VERIFIED.**
> Full evidence trail: `docs/plans/M31_STATE.md` ("Claude Final Audit (2026-09-16) — VERIFIED").

**FINAL AUDIT SUMMARY (Claude, 2026-09-16):**
Independently re-verified all 8 originally-reported live-acceptance defects and the 3 Round 2 pre-final findings at the source level (not from the report's prose): all confirmed genuinely fixed. Found and bounded-repaired 4 additional defects the reported evidence trail had missed, none requiring architecture/scope changes (rule 17, no new Codex handoff needed):
1. Flutter attachment-chip regression (3 tests) — the new `_ModelSelectorChip` used a literal `Chip`, colliding with `attachment_ui_test.dart`'s `find.byType(Chip)` guard. Fixed: rendered as `RawChip` instead.
2. Stale route-count guard (2 tests) — `route_classification.py` added M31's 3 new routes to the classification table but left `EXPECTED_ROUTE_COUNT` unbumped. Fixed: 68→71.
3. LM Studio Active Brain regression (2 tests) — M31's new verified-only gate on `PUT /providers/active-brain` was inserted above, and effectively deleted, the pre-existing (2026-09-12 User directive) fallback chain for catalogue-less local providers, making LM Studio permanently non-selectable as Active Brain. Fixed: the verified-only gate now applies only when the provider has a real catalogue; catalogue-less local providers keep the original client-model → config-override → hardcoded-literal chain.
4. Shared `ModelRouter` test-double signature drift (11 tests) + one unguarded best-effort call (3 tests) — `test_usage_meter_recording.py`'s `fake_router()` mocked the pre-M31 1-arg `_ordered_candidates`/`_model_for_role` signatures; M31 widened both. Fixed: mocks widened to `*a, **k`. Separately, the new `annotate_latest_turn` call in `/ask` assumed a full orchestrator context, breaking `test_workflow_continuation.py`'s minimal fakes; wrapped in the same defensive `try/except` pattern already used for the neighboring shadow-decision-engine call.

Full regression, re-run to a real terminal result after all 4 fixes: `pytest -q` **1798 passed, 10 failed** (every one of the 10 independently re-run against a clean `git stash`-restored `HEAD` and confirmed to already fail there — pre-existing, not M31-caused, zero new); full `flutter test` **135/135** (was 132/3 before fix #1); `flutter analyze` 0 errors, 2 pre-existing info lints.

**RELEASE:** Claude performed the release commit/push to `origin/master` per standing release authority, on direct User instruction this session.

**TIMESTAMP (opened / closed):**
2026-09-16T21:50:00+05:30 / 2026-09-16 (this pass)

**LIVE RE-TEST DEFECT DIRECTIVE FOR CODEX:**
User live re-test failed with exact live findings. Highest priority is reproducing against the exact live backend/UI runtime:
1. **Live Server Runtime Freshness & URI_PROVIDER_KEY_SECRET:**
   - The live server on port 8000 was running frozen PID 24888 started at 11:34 without reloading.
   - Hitting `http://127.0.0.1:8000/ask` live returned HTTP 500 while latest code passed.
   - In `uri_core/app/server.py`, add `os.environ.setdefault("URI_PROVIDER_KEY_SECRET", "uri_local_dev_secret_key_v1")` at module startup so ProviderKeyStore never fails with ValueError when started outside `scripts/run_uri_server.py`.
2. **Model Inventory Reconciliation:**
   - In the live server, `GET /providers` returned `models: ['qwen3:14b', 'gemma4:12b']` and `installed_models: ['qwen3.5:9b', 'gemma4:12b']`.
   - `qwen3.5:9b` was missing from `models` and thus missing from the chat selector!
   - In `server.py`, ensure `GET /providers` dynamically includes all `installed_models` in `provider.models` with `verified: true` for Ollama.
3. **Model Override & Turn Caption:**
   - When manual `gemma4:12b` is selected in composer, ensure `AskRequest.model_override` is transmitted from Flutter, backend honors it, persists the actual serving model in `ConversationTurn`, and caption shows `gemma4:12b` instead of reverting to `URI Auto`.
4. **Figma 1:71 Equal-Hierarchy 3 Cards:**
   - In `providers_screen.dart`, Subscription, API Key, and Local Models must read as equal-hierarchy Figma cards (Figma node 1:71) rather than expanding 7+ provider forms inline inside API Key / Local Models while Subscription is a small 3-line card.
5. **Real Live Verification:**
   - Test against the live server endpoint, verify real chat with `gemma4:12b`, real key storage, and unified inventory.

**CLAUDE ROUND 2 PRE-FINAL AUDIT — READY_FOR_USER_LIVE_RETEST (not a final verdict):**

Full report appended to `docs/plans/M31_CLAUDE_PREFINAL_REVIEW.md` ("Round 2"). Independently re-ran all 4 named suites (14/6/11 passed, `flutter analyze` 0 errors — exact match except 3 info-lints vs. the reported 2, cosmetic). Independently read the actual current source for each of the 8 claimed repairs, not just the report's prose:

- 7 of 8 defects (2.1 fallback safety net, 2.2 Anthropic native adapter, 5.4 fallback save, 5.5 inventory sync, 5.6 HTTP 500, 5.7 caption sync, 5.2 provider-state truthfulness) are **genuinely fixed, confirmed by direct code read** — not merely by trusting passing tests.
- Defect 5.1 (Figma fidelity): the literal complaint (legacy card/tab list still primary) is resolved and confirmed unreachable, but the replacement layout is **not actually 3 equal-hierarchy cards** — `_ProviderConnectionGroup` grows unboundedly per provider (5 providers for API Key, 2 for Local) next to a fixed 3-line Subscription card. Flagging for the User's re-test to visually confirm.
- Defect 5.3 (Groq): code fix is real and correctly staged, but `M31_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md` itself discloses no real Groq key was available to confirm the original failure is actually resolved — needs the User's live key.
- **New finding**, not one of the original 8: Anthropic's catalogued model id (`claude-3-5-sonnet`) may not be a valid Anthropic API model string (needs a versioned suffix or documented alias) — the adapter code itself is correct, but this could still cause a live 400. Worth the User specifically trying Anthropic in the re-test, not just Groq.
- Defect 5.8 (duplicate fallback): client-side only, no server-side enforcement — low-severity gap, noted, not blocking.

No code changes made in this pass. No ACCEPT/REPAIR REQUIRED verdict issued — gated on the User's own short live re-test per the standing live-verification gate revision.

**AUDIT DIRECTIVE FOR CLAUDE (LIVE ACCEPTANCE REPAIR PASS):**
Codex has completed the live repair pass for all 8 defects identified in the User Live Acceptance Report:
1. **Figma 1:71 Fidelity:** `ProvidersScreen` rebuilt around the approved Connect Provider layout (3 equal-hierarchy cards: Subscription, API Key, Local Models; 4-step explainer; Fallback Routing card). Conflicting legacy cards and tab choice chips are no longer rendered.
2. **Provider-State Truthfulness:** Provider status distinctly reflects configured, reachable, discovered, verified, and Active Brain. Unconfigured providers show "Connect provider to discover models". Only verified models can be selected as Active Brain.
3. **Groq API Key Connection:** Stage-specific error reporting added for credential storage, reachability, verification, and discovery. Key storage validated.
4. **Fallback Routing Save:** Fixed in `server.py` (`update_fallback_routing`) to recognize local installed Ollama models as valid selectable models without requiring recent `/verify` cache hit.
5. **Model Inventory Synchronization:** `GET /providers` merges dynamic local Ollama `installed_models` into verified inventory, unifying Active Brain, fallback routing, and chat model selector.
6. **End-to-End Chat Execution:** HTTP 500 fixed in `/ask` (eliminated undefined variable references and removed misplaced memory serialization helper references). Real `/ask` requests execute cleanly.
7. **Model Override & Captions:** Model override rebinds request-scoped reasoning adapters and persists actual serving metadata in `ConversationTurn` so caption accurately reflects served model.
8. **Redundant Fallback Choices:** Fallback routing dialog rejects duplicate selections across Primary, Fallback 1, and Fallback 2.

**TEST EVIDENCE:**
- `pytest tests/test_m31_model_brain_ux.py -v`: 14 passed
- `flutter test test/m22_5_providers_test.dart`: 6 passed
- `flutter test test/chat_lifecycle_test.dart`: 11 passed
- `flutter analyze`: 0 errors
- Real local Ollama query (`qwen3.5:9b`) succeeded with `URI MODEL TEST`
- Authenticated `/ask` with manual model override succeeded with serving metadata `ollama` / `qwen3.5:9b` without HTTP 500

**REQUIRED ACTION FOR CLAUDE:**
Conduct pre-final technical audit of the repairs. Verify that the production call paths are sound and the live defects are resolved, then record the audit report before handing back for the User live re-test.

**ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA BEFORE RETURN:**
- Codex reproduces and repairs each defect.
- Backend and Flutter unit/widget tests pass.
- Real local Ollama chat execution verified.
- Real manual model-override chat execution verified.
- Real attachment execution verified.
- Providers screen matches Figma 1:71 layout.

**IMPLEMENTATION RETURN (Codex, Batch 4):**
- Unified typography: removed hardcoded raw `fontFamily: 'Segoe UI'` literals across all 4 surfaces.
- Added semantic dashboard typography roles in `uri_theme.dart` (metric captions, values, key-value captions, and headers).
- Clean `flutter analyze` across all touched files.
- Focused suite: 23/23 tests passing.
- Native 1024×682 render regenerated and verified: `.tmp_m26_render/rebuilt_dashboard.png`.
- Protected Batch 3 scope strictly preserved (responsive scaling, theme propagation, local-model switching, continuous chat thread).

**AUDIT SUMMARY (Claude, 2026-09-14):** Independently re-ran (not re-quoted) `flutter analyze` (clean) and the 23-test focused suite (23/23) on all 5 touched files. Confirmed via direct `grep` that every raw `fontFamily: 'Segoe UI'` override is gone, that every geometry-critical `DashboardManifest.*FontSize` constant is still referenced at its original call site, and that `providers_screen.dart`/`turn_card.dart`/`DashboardScale` have zero diff from Batch 3 (protected scope genuinely untouched, not just claimed). Live-verified the rebuilt app at maximized size: responsive scaling, light-mode propagation, and the Active Brain all still correct.

**Found and bounded-repaired one real defect (rule 17 — no new Codex handoff):** `link()`'s action-button label (used by every card's "View full calendar"/"Change model"/etc. link) was restyled to the new `metricCaption` role, whose baked-in `inkFaint` color silently overrode the button's own `foregroundColor: colors.ink` (a Batch 3 fix) — found by direct visual inspection of the live rebuilt app (a 4x-zoomed crop showed visibly dimmed button text), not by reading the diff. Audited all 7 other semantic-role call sites individually — all correct; `link()` was the only wrong application. Fixed with `.copyWith(color: isDark ? ink : colors.ink)` at that one call site — re-verified: `flutter analyze` clean, 23/23 tests still pass, live screenshot confirms full-contrast button text restored in both themes. Full evidence in `docs/plans/URI_APPROVED_UI_BATCH4_AUDIT.md` §2.3.

**REQUIRED NEXT ACTION:**
Antigravity to record `FULL URI UI MILESTONE READY FOR USER REVIEW` in `docs/governance/URI_ACTIVE_MILESTONE.md`. No commit/push authorized — that remains the User's own, separate, explicit instruction. Do not start a new milestone without fresh User direction.

**STOP CONDITIONS:**
- Do not commit or push without separate explicit User instruction.
- Protect the 4 live-verified Batch 3 items (now 5, including the `link()` color fix).

**TIMESTAMP:**
2026-09-14T18:01:00+05:30 (opened) / 2026-09-14T19:50:00+05:30 (closed)

**LIVE-VERIFICATION SUMMARY (Claude, 2026-09-14):**
Root-caused and fixed all 6 items plus a 7th the User surfaced mid-pass
(local Ollama model switching was blocked once a provider was already
Active Brain). Two root causes were narrower/different than the
original packaged description once inspected directly (see the audit
doc's own corrections): item 3 ("hello" fails) was not a missing wire-
up — `conversational_classifier.py` was already correctly invoked, but
its safety gate failed closed on `requires_clarification` even for a
bare greeting, because the real `gemma4:12b` model reports that field
inconsistently for "hello"/"hi" versus "thanks!"/"what can you do?".
Item 1 (fullscreen scaling) traced to the left rail and the dashboard
board computing two INDEPENDENT scale factors that only agreed at the
board's native aspect ratio — replaced with one shared `DashboardScale`
authority.

Live-verified against the running `uri_ui.exe` + backend, including a
User-supplied light-mode reference screenshot as the visual target for
items 2/4, and a follow-up instruction to make chat read as one
continuous thread rather than per-turn "Completed" islands:
- Responsive scaling: native 1024×682, an intermediate 1500×950, and
  maximized — rail and board stay aligned at all three, no clipping.
- Light mode now reaches the sidebar, dashboard cards, hero banner,
  tabs, and composer (previously Settings-only).
- Local model dropdown/button no longer lock out switching models on
  an already-active provider; dropdown now lists real installed Ollama
  models, not just the static catalogue.
- `TurnCard` no longer wraps each turn in a boxed `Card`; turns render
  as one divider-separated thread, and the "Completed" pill is hidden
  for ordinary successful turns (still shown for Failed/Cancelled/
  Awaiting-approval/etc).
- Chat "hello"/"hi" now succeeds live end to end through the real
  classifier fix (a transient Ollama cold-start "could not reach model
  provider" failure during one live attempt was independently
  root-caused via direct backend retry — not a code defect).

Live-verification screenshots captured to `docs/design_references/`:
`verify_maximized_light_dashboard.png`, `verify_local_model_switching.png`,
`verify_continuous_chat_thread.png`.

`flutter analyze` clean on every touched file. Tests: 33/33
(`test_conversational_classifier.py` + `test_orchestrator_conversational_
no_capability.py`) and 23/23 (`dashboard_shell_test.dart`,
`reference_render_test.dart`, `redesign_test.dart`, `m22_ui_parity_test.dart`,
`ask_uri_flow_test.dart`) passing. One pre-existing broken test disclosed,
not caused by this pass: `chat_lifecycle_test.dart`'s approval-flow test
fails identically on the unmodified original file (confirmed via `git
stash` isolation). No broad/full regression re-run this pass, per

**USER FEEDBACK DIRECTIVE:**
"1. The app doesnt allow the dashbord to scale to full screen
2. The appreance settings has option to do dark mode or light mode, in light mode the light mode is only applicable to the settings menu only
3. The model might not be configured for chat (jst keeping note)
4. The app font also needs a rework
5. Settings>>connections option leads to connection option
6. The side bar image should blend in the side bar
..give these to claude to fix, dont do any tests yourself and wait for claude to finish"

**SUMMARY:**
User provided live testing feedback and 6 concrete defect repairs:
1. Dashboard framing does not scale to full screen on desktop (locked to 880x682 inside FittedBox with massive empty margins).
2. Light mode only applies to the Settings pane; sidebar and app shell remain hardcoded dark.
3. Chat greeting ("hello") fails with "URI does not have an implemented capability for this kind of task yet."
4. App typography needs a cohesive rework.
5. Settings >> Connections is a redundant placeholder pointing to the main Connections page.
6. Sidebar footer forest image needs seamless blending into the sidebar canvas.
Prior item: Brain onboarding missing model selection when Ollama is unreachable.

**REQUIRED NEXT ACTION (superseded — see STATUS/VERDICT above):**
~~Claude to review the tasks... implement the fixes, run all required verification and tests, and report back.~~
Done. Claude live-verified all 6 items + the brain-onboarding model-selection item; User has ACCEPTED. Scope is released back to Antigravity — see "REQUIRED NEXT ACTION (updated)" above for the actual current instruction.

**STOP CONDITIONS (unchanged):**
- Do not commit or push without separate explicit User instruction.
- No broad/full regression suite was re-run for this closing pass, per instruction — the targeted suites listed above were run instead.

## PREVIOUS HANDOFF (URI Approved UI Prototype — Ready for User Review)

**FROM:**
Codex

**TO:**
Claude

**MILESTONE:**
URI Approved UI Functional Prototype

**HANDOFF TYPE:**
AUDIT

**STATUS:**
COMPLETE — CLAUDE AUDIT PASS

**VERDICT:**

> **UI PROTOTYPE READY FOR USER REVIEW.**
> Full report: `docs/plans/URI_APPROVED_UI_BATCH2_AUDIT.md`.

**TIMESTAMP:**
2026-09-14T16:40:00+05:30 (opened) / 2026-09-14 (closed)

**AUTHORITATIVE ARTIFACTS:**

- docs/design_references/dashboard_preview.html
- uri_workspace/dev_workflow/tasks/ui_prototype_claude_batch2_audit_task.txt

**IMPLEMENTATION RETURN (Codex, Batch 2):**
- Metrics, panels, and remaining right-rail cards retain fixed outer and
  internal geometry through loading/live/unavailable states. The empty
  sparklines, hollow Model Usage donut, bare-dash values, and Storage's
  fabricated disk-breakdown presentation are repaired without any deferred
  telemetry or request-accounting backend.
- Native 1024x682 render: `.tmp_m26_render/rebuilt_dashboard.png`.
- Focused Flutter: 7/7 pass; analyzer: no issues. Full Flutter: 131 passed,
  1 failed — solely the previously disclosed standalone Chat approval-flow
  test.
- Native visual comparison and remaining deltas (including Tools & Skills
  falling below this capture) are recorded in the Batch 2 report.

**AUDIT SUMMARY (Claude, 2026-09-14):**
Independently re-verified every Batch 2 claim: three-state geometry
contract confirmed via direct source read + independent 7/7 test re-run
(including the new `Rect`-comparison test); every DEFER item (GPU,
Model Usage, Storage) checked field-by-field and confirmed honestly
`unavailable` with preserved chart/ring/meter shape, never fabricated;
every live field's real backend source re-confirmed.

**Found and bounded-repaired the disclosed right-rail overflow directly**
(explicitly authorized by this handoff's own task): computed the ~128px
content-vs-available-height gap by hand, then trimmed only cosmetic
spacing constants (`GlassPanel` padding, `kv()`/heading gaps, the
profile row's default `IconButton` tap-target padding, etc.) across two
small passes — zero content/copy/logic changed. Re-rendered and
confirmed "Tools & Skills" now fully visible with a clean margin.
Re-verified: focused suite 7/7 (incl. the geometry-equivalence test,
confirming the fix preserves state-to-state identity), full Flutter
suite 131 passed/1 failed (same pre-existing, disclosed, out-of-scope
Chat-screen failure, 0 new), full Python regression independently
re-run via `pytest` (this project's own established tool, not the
report's `unittest discover`): **1,761 passed, 16 failed** — exact
standing baseline, 0 new.

**Verdict: `UI PROTOTYPE READY FOR USER REVIEW`**, per
`docs/plans/URI_APPROVED_UI_BATCH2_AUDIT.md` §8. Two limitations
disclosed by name as non-blocking: left-rail/board geometry exact only
at native 1024×682 (a real architectural question, not a defect); the
pre-existing standalone Chat-screen approval-flow test failure
(unrelated to the dashboard, needs its own targeted investigation).

**REQUIRED NEXT ACTION:**
Antigravity to record `UI PROTOTYPE READY FOR USER REVIEW` in
`docs/governance/URI_ACTIVE_MILESTONE.md`. No commit/push authorized —
that remains the User's own, separate, explicit instruction. Do not
start a new milestone or Batch 3 without fresh User direction.

**STOP CONDITIONS (unchanged):**
- No commit or push without separate explicit User instruction.
- Do not start the next milestone automatically.

  audit: BUILD NOW = system performance, activity, connections, unread
  Gmail count (method exists, not yet wired); DEFER = GPU telemetry,
  model-usage accounting, reminders/scheduled tasks.
- **Bounded fix applied directly** (Claude, standing authority): `ask_uri_
  screen.dart:391`'s `UriColors.textMuted` (nonexistent static field,
  and a bare-static reference would violate `UriColors`'s own documented
  theme-resolution architecture regardless) → `UriColors.of(context).
  inkFaint` (the existing, semantically equivalent field). Verified:
  `flutter test test/reference_render_test.dart test/dashboard_shell_
  test.dart` now compiles and passes 6/6 (previously failed to compile
  at all); `flutter analyze` on the new manifest file — no issues; grep
  confirmed no other `UriColors.` static misuse repo-wide.
- **Codex batch 1 package** written to `uri_workspace/dev_workflow/tasks/
  ui_prototype_codex_task.txt` — deliberately narrow (fixed-board
  container for rail/hero/tabs only, nav dedup, composer send-icon fix,
  one bounded backend wiring task for the real unread-email count),
  explicitly excluding the metrics/panels/right-rail three-state repair
  and full visual fidelity work for later batches — matching this
  project's own forensic finding that bundling too much in one turn was
  a root cause of the earlier failed attempt.

**IMPLEMENTATION RETURN (Codex, Batch 1):**
- Fixed desktop board framing, manifest-sized left rail, manifest-driven
  13-item nav, and right-pointing composer icon are implemented.
- Read-only `GET /gmail/unread-count` is wired through `HttpUriClient`,
  `AppState`, and Today at a glance; unavailable results render honestly.
- Native 1024×682 render: `.tmp_m26_render/rebuilt_dashboard.png`.
- Focused Flutter: 6/6 pass; focused Python endpoint/route checks: 22/22
  pass; analyzer: no issues. Full-suite results and the one remaining
  Flutter approval-flow failure are recorded exactly in
  `docs/plans/URI_APPROVED_UI_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md`.

**REQUIRED NEXT ACTION:**
Antigravity to route the report and native render to Claude for the next
independent audit pass. No commit/push authorized; do not start Batch 2.

**STOP CONDITIONS (unchanged):**
- No commit or push without separate explicit User instruction.
- Preserve the approved URI dashboard visual reference.
- Repair the existing UI rather than redesigning it.
- Do not bundle batch 2 (metrics/panels/right-rail geometry repair, full
  visual fidelity) into batch 1 — Claude defines batch 2 after auditing
  batch 1's render/tests.

- `docs/plans/M30_8_CLAUDE_AUDIT.md`
- `uri_workspace/dev_workflow/tasks/m30_8_claude_audit_task.txt`

**AUDIT SUMMARY (Claude, 2026-09-14):**
Independently traced `/ask`'s real production path in `server.py`/
`canonical_execution.py` (canonical-first dispatch, terminal non-execution
envelopes, narrow reason-coded fallback, killswitch semantics — all
confirmed by direct source read, not assumed from the report) and
independently ran both required focused suites to a real terminal result
(38 + 22 passed, exact match to the report).

**Found and bounded-repaired one real defect (rule 17 — no new Codex
handoff):** the plan's own §2 claim that `WorkflowPlanner` had "exactly
one real template" was factually wrong — a second, behaviorally load-
bearing 4-step template (ending in `prepare_output`, which honestly
reports a genuine capability gap as `"failed"`) existed and was silently
replaced by the always-`draft_output` template, which "must always draft
SOMETHING." This converted honest capability-gap failures into fabricated
`"success"` results (7 failing tests, including a narrative hallucinated-
success-rejection safety test). Reverted `_create_steps()` to restore the
original task-type distinction; re-verified 41/41 + both required suites
again (43 passed) — zero regression from the repair itself.

**Environment change disclosed:** the User removed Ollama model
`qwen3:14b` mid-audit. Every resulting failure was individually re-run and
root-caused (never assumed from a plausible pattern) — 8 are independently
confirmed `ENVIRONMENT_CHANGED` (direct `ModelNotFoundError` or a confirmed
no-mock real-model dependency), not code regressions; Qwen was not
reinstalled.

**Full regression, final state:** 1,755 passed, 16 failed (the standing
8-item name-matched baseline + the 8 environment-caused failures above),
32 subtests passed. Zero new, unexplained, or unfixed failures.
`test_evidence_pipeline.py` (a live-network script, not a test) excluded
and disclosed.

**Governance note (flagged, not self-corrected):**
`docs/governance/URI_ACTIVE_MILESTONE.md` §4 "CURRENT WRITE SCOPE" still
describes the old M30-PFC scope despite §1 naming M30.8 as current —
Antigravity should correct this per its own Write Ownership rule.

**FOLLOW-UP (Claude, 2026-09-14) — canonical unsupported-dispatch repair,
CLAUDE ACCEPT:** after the ACCEPT above and the User's separate commit/push
of the accepted M22.5-M30.8 backend history, a test-only Gemma 4
(`gemma4:12b`) evaluation (`docs/research/GEMMA4_EVALUATION_REPORT.md`,
explicitly not a milestone, not a production switch) surfaced two
well-reasoned canonical `unsupported` decisions being misrouted to legacy
fallback. Audited in `docs/plans/M30_8_CANONICAL_UNSUPPORTED_DISPATCH_
AUDIT.md`: root cause was `decision_gates.py`'s "false unsupported claim
rejected by directory" verdict — a real, decided outcome, not an engine
failure — reusing the `INVALID_PROPOSAL` enum value `canonical_
execution.py`'s dispatch treats as an unconditional fallback trigger. User
approved the narrowest identified repair (rule 17, no new Codex handoff):
`decide_fallback_reason()` now inspects the gate's own `reasons` list and
does not fall back specifically for that one reason string; every other
`INVALID_PROPOSAL` cause is unaffected; `decision_gates.py` untouched (0
bytes changed); no schema change. All 6 planned tests pass, including a
live re-run of the exact two original Gemma prompts (both now terminate
through canonical) and a full regression (1,759 passed, 16 failed — same
standing baseline, 0 new). Full evidence in that audit doc's §10.
**Verdict: ACCEPT.** This was the item blocking Phase A's own exit
criteria (§B.3 item 3). No commit/push performed for this repair — awaiting
separate, final User approval.

**FOLLOW-UP 2 (Claude, 2026-09-14) — Phase A live observation + Phase B
disposition, M30 COMPLETE:** ran a focused live observation battery (13
real `POST /ask` calls through the real FastAPI app/orchestrator/canonical
dispatch, real `gemma4:12b` output via the same test-only override
methodology, no source/production default changed). Full evidence in
`docs/plans/M30_8_PHASE_A_OBSERVATION_AND_PHASE_B_DISPOSITION.md`.
**Result: 1/13 fallback, genuine** (malformed model proposal, reason-coded
`engine_failure:INVALID_PROPOSAL:invalid_mode`, cross-attributed in both
telemetry logs); zero non-genuine fallbacks; the exact defect class fixed
in Follow-up 1 did not recur under fresh model output. **Phase A exit
criteria (§B.3): MET**, scoped honestly to this project's own established
single-session live-battery practice. **Phase B: no mechanism required or
received a code change** — direct source re-check found item 1
(`WorkflowPlanner`) correctly remains reverted (retrying it without
action-level capability matching would repeat the same regression), item
2 (legacy `semantic_interpreter.py`) was **already deleted in M22.5**
(commit `a49acfa`, long before M30.8), items 3-4 already complete, items
5-7 never retirement candidates. Final full regression (run once, after
this review): **1,759 passed, 16 failed, 40 subtests passed** — identical
16 test names to Follow-up 1's own run, zero new failures.

> **M30 COMPLETE — ACCEPT.**

No commit/push performed — awaiting the User's separate, explicit
approval for that, per standing instruction.

**REQUIRED NEXT ACTION:**
Antigravity to record `M30 COMPLETE — ACCEPT` and this Phase A/Phase B
disposition in `docs/governance/URI_ACTIVE_MILESTONE.md`, and correct the
stale §4 write-scope note above. Commit/push remains withheld pending the
User's own explicit, separate instruction.

**STOP CONDITIONS (unchanged):**
- Do NOT commit or push without separate explicit User instruction.
- Do NOT touch `uri_ui/` (confirmed untouched by this audit and its repair).
- Do NOT begin Phase B item 4 (`orchestrator.py` retirement) before the
  Phase A live observation window (§B.3) is actually run.

**IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY:**
- Canonical-first `/ask` dispatch, terminal valid non-execution envelopes, and
  reason-coded legacy fallback observation are implemented.
- WorkflowPlanner's duplicate task-type dispatch is flattened to the published
  generic procedure.  Semantic-interpreter zero-caller and explicit
  MultiActionDispatch migration checks are recorded in the implementation
  report.
- Focused suites: 38 + 22 tests passing.
- Full `pytest -q` was started and remains in progress; it had existing/other
  failures before completion, so no full-regression verdict is claimed.
- Phase A live observation and the plan's 12-scenario gate remain required
  before destructive fallback-priority-block retirement.

- `docs/governance/URI_ACTIVE_MILESTONE.md`
- `uri_workspace/dev_workflow/tasks/m30_8_codex_implementation_task.txt`

**SUMMARY:**
User explicitly authorized implementation of M30.8 on 2026-09-14:
"I explicitly authorize implementation of the revised:
M30.8 — CANONICAL CUTOVER + LEGACY RETIREMENT".

Codex is the implementer for M30.8.

Execution requirements:
1. Codex implements Phase A (Canonical Cutover) and Phase B (Legacy Retirement).
2. Canonical Brain is made default authority in `/ask`.
3. Legacy may run ONLY as narrow, reason-coded fallback for genuine engine/provider failure (`MODEL_TERMINALLY_UNAVAILABLE`, `INVALID_PROPOSAL`/`DEGRADED`).
4. Valid canonical outcomes (clarification, unsupported, disconnected, approval_required, conversation, etc.) terminate normally and do NOT trigger legacy fallback.
5. Observe and record all remaining legacy invocations with explicit reason codes.
6. Retire legacy mechanisms one at a time in Phase B, migrating responsibilities before retirement.
7. Run focused tests after each bounded change.
8. Run one final full regression suite at the end to a real terminal result.
9. Deliver report in `docs/plans/M30_8_CANONICAL_CUTOVER_LEGACY_RETIREMENT_REPORT.md`.
10. Antigravity will route completed implementation back to Claude for independent audit.
11. Claude independently audits the entire cutover and retirement.
12. If Claude finds REPAIR REQUIRED within already-approved M30.8 scope: Claude fixes it directly, runs focused tests, re-verifies, and continues audit (do NOT start a new Codex handoff loop for ordinary bounded audit repairs).
13. If a repair expands architecture/scope/security or cannot be safely bounded: stop and return for User approval.
14. Repeat Claude repair -> verification -> self-audit until final verdict:
    `M30 COMPLETE — ACCEPT` or `M30.8 REPAIR REQUIRED — <exact out-of-scope issue>`.

## PREVIOUS HANDOFF (CLOSED)

**FROM:**
Claude

**TO:**
User (Antigravity)

**MILESTONE:**
Graphify Foundation (Plan A)

**HANDOFF TYPE:**
AUTONOMOUS_LOOP - Claude implemented directly (no reachable Codex/
Antigravity session, same established exception as M23/M30-PFC/
Scenario 2), self-verified, self-audited. **This is the reference
shape for the autonomous loop the User asked to be re-established:
Claude → (Antigravity relay/monitoring, mechanically a no-op this
round since no session was reachable) → Claude verification/self-
audit → bounded repair if needed (none needed) → final verdict →
WAITING_FOR_USER_DECISION.** Antigravity should adopt this same shape
for every future milestone: coordinate continuously, never stop merely
because User approval is pending on a different item, never implement
or audit itself.

**STATUS:**
COMPLETE - Claude ACCEPT (2026-09-14)

**VERDICT:**

> **GRAPHIFY FOUNDATION — ACCEPT**

**SUMMARY:**
Implemented Plan A exactly as approved: `startup_services.py` (generic
`StartupService`/`run_startup_services()`), `graphify_index.py`
(system-level index, sourced entirely from real, already-generic
authorities - `CapabilityDirectory`, `SkillMemory`, `WorkflowPlanner`,
`MemoryStore` - pointers only, never copied content), `server.py`'s
`_lifespan()` now runs a real service list, `turn_state.py` gained one
additive `capability_index_hint` field. 37/37 tests passing. Live-
verified: a real startup built a real 71-record index from the live
system; a corrupted persisted index was quarantined (never deleted)
and the server - real login, real `/ask` - worked normally throughout.
Full regression: 1,768 total, 8 pre-existing failures (exact baseline
match), 0 new. Self-audit against the plan's own 6 acceptance criteria:
all hold.

**Plan B (M30.8 Canonical Cutover + Legacy Retirement) remains NOT
AUTHORIZED and NOT started** - today's approval covered Plan A only,
per the User's explicit instruction.

**Antigravity: no action required for Plan B until a fresh, separate
User authorization arrives.** Continue coordinating; do not stop.

**TIMESTAMP:**
2026-09-14

**SUMMARY:**
Per User instruction, produced two read-only, not-yet-implemented
plans reflecting a new architectural direction adopted after M30
readiness was accepted: (A) `docs/plans/M30_GRAPHIFY_FOUNDATION_PLAN.md`
- a lightweight, additive, system-level capability/skill/workflow/
dependency/availability/provenance index, loaded at startup via a new
generic `StartupService` lifecycle, read-only/no authority; (B)
`docs/plans/M30_8_CANONICAL_CUTOVER_LEGACY_RETIREMENT_PLAN.md` -
merges the original M30.8+M30.10 into one milestone (Phase A: canonical
default + Graphify available + legacy inverted to a logged fallback;
Phase B: per-mechanism legacy retirement once proven), superseding
`M30_8_CANONICAL_DEFAULT_CUTOVER_PRE_AUDIT.md`. Both preserve the
completed M30 readiness evidence as a baseline, not reopened.

**Antigravity: no action required.** Neither plan is authorized.
Do not route anything to Codex/Gemma for this yet.

**MILESTONE:**
M30.7C resumption + Scenario 2 Connection Gate Repair

**HANDOFF TYPE:**
READINESS_CONCLUSION

**STATUS:**
COMPLETE

**TIMESTAMP:**
2026-09-14

**SUMMARY:**
Per User instruction, resumed M30.7C's focused live verification
(Scenarios 2, 6, 7, 8, 12), found and root-caused a real Scenario 2
architectural gap (Decision Engine rejecting a disconnected
capability's own honest "unsupported" self-report before the
connection gate could evaluate it), produced a bounded repair plan
(`docs/plans/M30_SCENARIO2_CONNECTION_GATE_REPAIR_PLAN.md`), received
User approval, implemented it exactly as scoped (`decision_gates.py`
only), and closed it with live evidence (real `DISCONNECTED` +
`capability_id: "Gmail"` in telemetry, zero regression). Combined with
the already-closed Scenario 8/12 evidence and the upgraded Scenario 7
mechanism proof, rebuilt the full 12-scenario matrix and ran the full
regression to a real terminal result (1,743 items, 8 pre-existing
failures, 0 new).

**READINESS CONCLUSION: M30.8 READY FOR USER APPROVAL** - see
`docs/governance/URI_ACTIVE_MILESTONE.md` § "READINESS CONCLUSION" and
`docs/plans/M30_7C_READINESS_EVIDENCE_CLOSURE_REPORT.md` for full
evidence. **M30.8 has NOT been started and remains NOT AUTHORIZED**
pending the User's own explicit authorization - readiness is not
authorization, per this file's own standing protocol.

**MILESTONE:**
M30-PFC — Provider-Failure False-Consent Repair

**HANDOFF TYPE:**
DIRECT_IMPLEMENTATION_AND_AUDIT

**STATUS:**
COMPLETE - Claude ACCEPT (2026-09-14)

**TIMESTAMP:**
2026-09-13T23:29:30+05:30 (opened) / 2026-09-14 (closed)

**CLOSURE NOTE (Claude, 2026-09-14):**
Found the implementation already on disk (written by Codex before
pausing for quota) and independently verified it end-to-end rather
than trusting the prior report - see `docs/plans/M30_PROVIDER_FAILURE_
FALSE_CONSENT_STATE.md` "2026-09-14: Claude ACCEPT" for the full
evidence trail (source trace, 15/15 tests, live telemetry cross-check,
scope-boundary git-status check, and a real completed regression run:
8 failed/1735 passed/27 subtests passed, matching this handoff's own
1,726-baseline + 9 new tests = 1,735, with all 8 failures independently
re-confirmed pre-existing via git-stash comparison against the
pre-repair code, not caused by this repair).

**Verdict: ACCEPT.** All 7 required-verification items independently
confirmed. M30.8 remains NOT AUTHORIZED. Antigravity: do not start
M30.8; this milestone (M30-PFC) is closed.

- `test_provider_failure_false_consent_repair.py`
- `uri_core/core/orchestrator.py`
- `uri_core/core/skill_memory.py`

**SUMMARY:**
User directive (2026-09-13T23:29): Codex usage limit was about to hit, so Codex was paused.
User explicitly directed: "i will implement it though claude directly".

Claude is requested to directly take ownership of M30-PFC implementation, verification, and audit.

Workspace Status:
- `.gitignore`: keeps `URI.json` protected.
- `connection_status.py`: clean M30.6A baseline restored.
- `gmail_service.py`: clean M30.6A baseline restored.
- `uri_core/core/orchestrator.py`: contains the three-way model availability check.
- `uri_core/core/skill_memory.py`: contains the empty task_type/domain rejection.
- `test_provider_failure_false_consent_repair.py`: 9 tests including Test #9.

Implementation instructions and requirements:

1. **Primary fix** - `uri_core/core/orchestrator.py`'s semantic-
   interpretation except-handler (~lines 379-392): distinguish genuine
   unreachability (`AllProvidersUnreachableError`-originated) from a
   reached-but-malformed response - only the former is `MODEL_
   TERMINALLY_UNAVAILABLE`. Add a small, additive marker to the
   degraded dict (e.g. `"interpretation_unreachable": True`) for the
   genuine-unreachability case only.
2. Gate the `elif learned_skill:` branch (~lines 4742-4762): fire only
   when NOT in `MODEL_TERMINALLY_UNAVAILABLE` state for this turn
   (check the new marker from (1) and/or `model_reasoning.get(
   "status") == "reasoning_failed"` for the reasoning-side half of the
   same signal - `"reasoning_disabled"` must NOT count). When gated
   off, fail closed: do not execute `remember_fact` or any other
   learned-skill tool, do not perform any persistent side effect,
   return the deterministic model-unavailable response (reuse the
   existing `drafting_provider_unreachable`-style honest-degradation
   pattern already in `response_drafting.py` - no new mechanism).
3. **Defense-in-depth** - `uri_core/core/skill_memory.py`'s
   `find_matching_skill()` (~lines 129-177): reject a match where both
   `task_type` and `domain` are empty strings.
4. **Explicitly do not touch:** `remember_fact.py`, `MemoryStore`/
   `user_memory.py`, any consent/provenance model, `capability_
   planner.py`, or any learned-skill logic beyond (2).
5. **Escape hatch, binding:** if the three-way distinction cannot be
   represented cleanly at the existing call sites without broader
   architectural change, STOP and report back rather than improvising.

**Required verification (all 7, exactly per the User's list):**
1. All 9 new repair tests passing (plan §6: unrelated-text-cannot-
   execute, no-memory-side-effect, no-false-provenance, empty-match-
   rejected-standalone, learned-skill-cannot-bypass-live-turn-even-
   with-a-confident-non-empty-match, healthy-disclosure-still-works,
   existing-6-tests-unbroken, live-server-re-reproduction, **and (added
   2026-09-13 per product review) no approval-gated/side-effecting
   capability executes either during model-failure state - plan §6
   item 9, already expected to pass given `capability_planner.py`'s
   own verified behavior, but must be proven not assumed**).
2. Re-run `test_orchestrator_skill_memory_execution.py` unchanged -
   all 6 must still pass.
3. Reproduce the exact prior scenario (`OLLAMA_BASE_URL` unreachable,
   real authenticated `/ask`, "What is the weather in Delhi today?")
   against a real server.
4. Confirm from that reproduction: deterministic model-unavailable
   response, no learned-skill execution, no `remember_fact` execution,
   no persistent memory write, no false `user_provided` provenance.
5. Verify healthy-path explicit memory disclosure ("I work at NIT
   Sikkim.") still works live.
6. Full regression suite to a real, observed terminal result (never
   report an unobserved/killed run - this session's own hard-learned
   lesson) - compare against the known 1,726/8/0-new baseline.
7. Hand back to Claude for independent audit before this is treated
   as closed - Claude does not pre-accept based on this handoff alone.

**REQUIRED NEXT ACTION:**
Antigravity to route this implementation directive to Codex. Codex
implements, runs all required verification, produces a report citing
real artifacts (source diffs, test output, telemetry, response
bodies), and returns for Claude's independent audit.

**STOP CONDITIONS:**
- Do NOT start or implement M30.8 - remains NOT AUTHORIZED until this
  repair receives Claude ACCEPT.
- Do NOT touch `uri_ui/`.
- Do NOT commit or push without separate explicit User instruction.
- Do NOT redesign `remember_fact`, `MemoryStore`, consent semantics,
  or learned-skill architecture beyond the approved gate.
- Do NOT collapse the three-way model-failure distinction into two.
- If the condition cannot be represented cleanly, STOP and report -
  do not improvise a workaround.
- Do NOT resume or reopen M30.7C's own separate scope as part of this
  milestone.

**AUTHORITATIVE ARTIFACTS:**
- `docs/plans/M30_7C_CLAUDE_AUDIT.md`

**SUMMARY:**
Did not trust Codex's report alone - independently reproduced Scenario
12's defect live (own fresh loopback server, own `/ask` call). **The
defect is real and reproduces on demand.** Real usage-log records for
the reproduction show every model role - `semantic_interpretation`,
`reasoning` (x2), `drafting` (x2) - as `outcome: unreachable`. **Zero
model calls succeeded anywhere in the turn**, yet `remember_fact`
executed for real and persisted an unrelated weather question, falsely
tagged `consent: "user_provided"`. This is a deterministic code
defect, not model hallucination or ordinary variance - categorically
more serious than every other scenario this session, given the false
consent tag on a real persisted memory write.

**Six candidate mechanisms checked directly against source, five ruled
out with evidence:** `capability_planner.py`'s disclosure scoring
(empirically tested with the exact degraded input - correctly returns
`planning_required`), the M30.5A disclosure regex (no match, and
structurally unreachable on total unavailability), `_recover_
capability_mentions()` (no matching keys in a failed-reasoning dict),
`MultiActionDispatch.dispatch()` (registry only ever contains Gmail),
`skill_memory`'s learned-skill path (advisory-only, needs a successful
model read). **One remaining candidate not ruled in or out:**
`_run_acceptance_retention_step`/`_model_retention_candidate` - stated
explicitly as unverified rather than guessed, since pinpointing it
further would need debug instrumentation (a source change requiring
its own approval).

**Real-data correction performed (not a source change):** removed the
two spurious, falsely-consent-tagged memory entries this investigation
and Codex's own reproduction created from the real `user_memory.json`
- disclosed transparently. Test server cleanly shut down.

**Also audited this round's fresh Scenario 2** (`INVALID_PROPOSAL`
again - consistent with the already-diagnosed model-naming variance
from last round, not a new defect) **and Scenario 8** (model selected
a different, legitimate draft capability rather than `Gmail`/
`create_draft` - not a defect; structural no-send proof re-confirmed).

**Recommendation:** treat the Scenario 12 defect as its own, separate,
dedicated, User-approved investigation-and-repair milestone given its
real privacy/consent severity - do not fold it into M30.7C's own
narrower evidence-closure mandate. M30.7C's remaining scope (fresh
Scenario 2/8 canonical evidence, best-effort Scenario 7, regression)
can proceed independently of that decision.

**REQUIRED NEXT ACTION:**
Return to the User for a scope decision on two independent tracks:
(1) whether/how to authorize a dedicated investigation-and-repair
milestone for the confirmed Scenario 12 defect (debug instrumentation
to pinpoint the exact line, then a bounded fix); (2) whether to
continue M30.7C's own remaining mandatory/best-effort scenarios and
regression pass now, separately. Do not fold the two together or
treat either as blocking the other without the User's own direction.

**STOP CONDITIONS:**
- Do NOT start or implement M30.8.
- Do NOT make canonical execution global.
- Do NOT touch `uri_ui/`.
- Do NOT commit or push without separate explicit User instruction.
- Do NOT apply any source repair for the Scenario 12 defect without a
  new, explicit scope approval - unchanged from the original protocol.

- `docs/plans/M30_7C_CLAUDE_AUDIT.md`

**SUMMARY:**
Codex executed M30.7C evidence capture and cleanly halted under the mandatory defect-handling protocol:
1. Scenario 12 exposed a real visible-fallback defect: with isolated provider failure (`OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:19999`), canonical telemetry recorded `fallback_reason: "invalid_contract:unavailable"`, but the actual `/ask` HTTP response returned success and saved `"What is the weather in Delhi today?"` into memory via `remember_fact` (`memory_id: "7d166b15-1950-40b3-9ea6-c2408dbd25e6"`) instead of an honest refusal/unavailable narrative.
2. Scenario 2 and Scenario 8 were captured with exact HTTP bodies in `uri_workspace/evidence/m30_7c_live_capture.json`.
3. Scenario 7 and regression pass were stopped per the binding defect-handling rule.
4. Codex delivered `docs/plans/M30_7C_READINESS_EVIDENCE_CLOSURE_REPORT.md` with disposition:
   `M30.8 NOT READY — Scenario 12 has a confirmed visible provider-unavailable fallback defect; Scenario 2 lacks fresh canonical DISCONNECTED evidence; Scenario 8 lacks fresh canonical APPROVAL_REQUIRED content-envelope evidence; Scenario 7 and terminal regression remain unexecuted under the mandatory stop-on-defect rule.`
5. Claude is requested to independently audit the defect evidence, formulate the architectural diagnosis/remediation requirements, and record the audit in `docs/plans/M30_7C_CLAUDE_AUDIT.md`.

**REQUIRED NEXT ACTION:**
Claude independently audit M30.7C closure report and Scenario 12 defect per `uri_workspace/dev_workflow/tasks/claude_m30_7c_defect_audit_task.txt`, update `docs/plans/M30_7C_CLAUDE_AUDIT.md`, and update this mailbox with status and verdict.

AUDIT

**STATUS:**
COMPLETE (superseded by CURRENT HANDOFF above)

**VERDICT:**
NOT A CONFIRMED DEFECT - ONE MORE DIAGNOSTIC LIVE ATTEMPT REQUIRED (no source change, no new approval needed)

**TIMESTAMP:**
2026-09-13T17:35:00Z

**AUTHORITATIVE ARTIFACTS:**
- `docs/plans/M30_7C_CLAUDE_AUDIT.md`

**SUMMARY:**
Confirmed Codex's stop-and-ask was disciplined and correct: fixture
pre-check independently sound (Gmail genuinely reports disconnected),
telemetry matches exactly, zero source files touched, clean teardown.

**Root-cause trace, not a guess:** `invalid_contract:unknown_
capability` comes from `decision_engine.py`'s contract validation
(`known_ids = capability_directory.summaries()`) rejecting the model's
proposed capability **before** `evaluate_gates()`/Gate 1 ever runs -
entirely upstream of the connection-truth mechanism the fixture was
built to exercise. Confirmed `summaries()` is deliberately
availability-blind (per its own docstring) - disconnection does NOT,
by design, remove Gmail from the known set, ruling out the obvious
guess. Real candidate: `_suppressed_legacy_ids()` (M30.5A's Gmail-
overlap policy) deliberately excludes the legacy `gmail_search` alias
so only `Gmail` is visible - if the model named the legacy alias
instead of the canonical one, that alone explains the rejection, with
zero code defect (the same "model said a plausible-but-wrong name"
pattern already seen for scenario 6/9 this session).

**What's genuinely unconfirmed:** the raw model text that would settle
this (`DecisionOutcome.raw_text`) isn't persisted to telemetry
(privacy-safe by design) and wasn't separately captured this round.
Per this repository's Evidence Integrity Rules, this is stated
explicitly rather than rounded up to either "confirmed benign" or
"confirmed defect."

**Recommended next step - no new approval needed:** one more live
`/ask` attempt against the *same, already-validated* fixture,
capturing the model's actual proposed capability name this time. This
is read-only diagnostic evidence on an already-approved scenario, not
a source change or scope expansion. If it shows the legacy alias was
named: benign, resume scenario 2 normally, then 7/8/12/regression. If
it shows `Gmail` was named correctly and still rejected: that is a
real, confirmed defect - stop again exactly as this round did, and
return for a genuine scope decision before any repair.

**Explicitly no readiness conclusion this round:** scenarios 7, 8, 12,
and the regression pass were never reached (Codex correctly stopped
before them). No 12-scenario matrix, no `M30.8 READY`/`NOT READY` line
can be honestly produced from this round's evidence alone.

**REQUIRED NEXT ACTION:**
Antigravity to route the diagnostic re-attempt (§4 of the audit) to
Codex - same fixture, same scenario, capture the raw proposed
capability name. No new User approval required for this specific step
(read-only, already in scope). Depending on result, either resume the
M30.7C plan's remaining scenarios normally, or stop again for a real
scope decision if `Gmail` was named correctly and still rejected.

**STOP CONDITIONS:**
- Do NOT start or implement M30.8.
- Do NOT make canonical execution global.
- Do NOT touch `uri_ui/`.
- Do NOT commit or push without separate explicit User instruction.
- Do NOT apply any source repair without stopping for a new, explicit
  approval first - unchanged from the original M30.7C plan.

**SUMMARY:**
Codex executed M30.7C directive and strictly complied with the binding defect-handling protocol:
- Scenario 2 corrected fixture validated before `/ask`: `credentials.json` copied to isolated `URI_GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_DIR` with invalid `token.json`. Pre-check confirmed `ensure_connected_from_token()` → `{"connected": false, "reason": "invalid_token"}` and capability unavailable due to `["gmail_connected"]`.
- Upon live `/ask` turn, execution fell back with `invalid_contract:unknown_capability` (`selected_capability: null`, `gate_outcome: null`) instead of evaluating Gate 1 to `DISCONNECTED`.
- Per binding rule: Codex stopped immediately without applying speculative source fixes, safely shut down isolated server, deleted temporary fixture, modified zero production code, and returned for scope decision.
- Claude is requested to independently audit the evidence and telemetry, formulate the architectural diagnosis, and provide the audit verdict/scope decision in `docs/plans/M30_7C_CLAUDE_AUDIT.md`.

ACCEPT

**TIMESTAMP:**

**AUTHORITATIVE ARTIFACTS:**
- `docs/plans/M30_7B_CLAUDE_AUDIT.md` (addendum)

**SUMMARY:**
The repair was genuine, not re-asserted. Cross-checked every fresh
session ID this round against `canonical_execution_log.jsonl` field-
by-field - every claim matched exactly: real login retry, scenario 6's
3-success/1-variance pattern, scenario 8 reaching real
`APPROVAL_REQUIRED` **twice** (real progress since last round, which
only hit `MISSING_PARAMETER`), scenario 7's real `search_messages`
success against the real account, and scenarios 2/5/12's specific real
`LIVE_FAIL` telemetry (not the disproven "blocked by environment"
claim from last round).

**Regression - investigated a discrepancy, resolved as a false alarm.**
`.pytest_cache/lastfailed` showed 9 entries, one beyond the known
8-failure baseline (`test_draft_institutional_note.py`). Independently
re-ran that specific test: **6 passed, 0 failed** right now - a stale
cache artifact, not a real regression. Spot-checked two real baseline
failures directly - both still genuinely fail as expected. The
report's "0 new failures" claim is corroborated, not just trusted.

**Source discipline:** confirmed zero unauthorized changes;
`CANONICAL_EXECUTION_ALLOWLIST` unchanged.

**Verdict: ACCEPT.** Every remaining `LIVE_FAIL` has a specific,
telemetry-corroborated reason - none an overclaim or an excuse.
**Independently agrees: M30.8 NOT READY.** Remaining blockers
(scenario 2 never reaches real `DISCONNECTED`; scenario 5's model
chooses one-time action over honest refusal; scenario 7 lacks a real
attachment-bearing message; scenario 8's pre-approval content envelope
unobserved; scenario 9 not Layer-3 ready; scenario 12's visible
end-user fallback message unconfirmed) are real and **not fixable
within this milestone's two authorized source boundaries** - each
needs its own separately-scoped, User-authorized follow-up.

**REQUIRED NEXT ACTION:**
Antigravity to record `LIVE_VERIFIED + CLAUDE ACCEPT` for M30.7B and
the independently confirmed `M30.8 NOT READY` disposition in
`docs/governance/URI_ACTIVE_MILESTONE.md`. M30.8 authorization remains
the User's own, non-delegable decision - not implied by this verdict.
If the User wants to continue, each remaining blocker is its own
separately-scoped decision, not a single next milestone.

**STOP CONDITIONS:**
- Do NOT start M30.8 - not authorized regardless of this verdict.
- Do NOT make canonical execution global.
- Do NOT touch `uri_ui/`.
- Do NOT commit or push without separate explicit User instruction.

- Scenario 9 is not Layer-3 ready: no result schema/action schemas and no
  canonical executor branch; allowlist remains `{"Gmail", "remember_fact"}`.
- `GmailService` has no send methods/calls.
- URI and Ollama were healthy, but the documented account did not authenticate
  with the one documented/default credential. No guessing, bearer-token
  inspection, account creation, fake principal, or fabricated service evidence
  was used. This blocks fresh authenticated `/ask` closure for scenarios 2, 5,
  6, 7, 8, and 12.

M30.7B — Canonical Readiness Closure

**HANDOFF TYPE:**
PLAN

**STATUS:**
COMPLETE

**APPROVAL:**
User explicitly approved M30.7B directly to Claude. Recorded in `docs/governance/URI_ACTIVE_MILESTONE.md` §6b (`APPROVAL RELAY: CLAUDE`).

**TIMESTAMP:**
2026-09-13T15:10:00Z

**AUTHORITATIVE ARTIFACTS:**
- `docs/plans/M30_7B_CANONICAL_READINESS_CLOSURE_PLAN.md`
- `docs/plans/M30_7B_STATE.md`

**SUMMARY:**
User directly requested M30.7B to close the 6 `LIVE_FAIL` scenarios M30.7A left open (2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12) and resolve scenario 9's per-capability admission decision. Claude produced a root-cause-first plan, not a repair-first one.

AUDIT

**STATUS:**
COMPLETE (superseded by CURRENT HANDOFF above)

**VERDICT:**
ACCEPT

**TIMESTAMP:**
2026-09-13T14:40:00Z

**AUTHORITATIVE ARTIFACTS:**
- `docs/plans/M30_7A_CLAUDE_AUDIT.md`

**SUMMARY:**
Independently verified the bounded repair directly in source
(`orchestrator.py:4592-4600`, exact match to plan spec) and re-ran
`test_workflow_continuation.py` (9/9, matches report). Cross-checked
all 7 fresh-attempt session IDs the report cites directly against
`canonical_execution_log.jsonl` field-by-field - every claim matched
exactly, zero discrepancies (scenarios 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10). Confirmed
structurally: scenario 9's allowlist-block claim (`canonical_
execution.py:74`, unchanged), scenario 8's "no send path" claim
(`gmail_service.py` grep - zero send methods). Did not personally
reproduce the full ~26-minute, 1734-test suite; all 8 claimed baseline
failures independently confirmed to be real, existing test files.

**Self-caught correction, posted here for transparency:** a broader
23-file regression subset Claude attempted as extra corroboration
timed out, moved to background, and was later killed by the system for
low memory before producing any output. Claude's first pass at this
audit and its chat summary to the User incorrectly reported that
subset as having run "clean" - no result was ever actually observed
for it. Corrected in `docs/plans/M30_7A_CLAUDE_AUDIT.md` §6 and
`docs/plans/M30_7A_STATE.md`: that subset is now excluded from the
evidence basis entirely. This does not change the verdict - ACCEPT
rests on the real 9/9 `test_workflow_continuation.py` result (the
suite directly covering the changed code), the report's own fresh
full-suite run, and independent confirmation the 8 baseline failures
are real - not on the retracted claim.

**Assessment of the 6 `LIVE_FAIL` scenarios:** none are defects in
M30.7A's own work - each is either real model-behavior variance
(consistent with M30.4's documented clarification bias), a genuine
data/environment limit, or an honestly-labeled incomplete attempt.
Exactly the discipline this session's audits have required throughout.

**Independently confirmed finding:** the M30.2 `WorkflowPlanner`
template-inventory gap Claude's own M30.8 pre-audit could not resolve
from documentation is now confirmed absent by Codex's own structural
check - a real, disclosed item any future M30.8 plan must resolve.

**Verdict: ACCEPT.** M30.7A's scope was honest evidence closure plus
one bounded repair - delivered correctly, safely, verified true.
**Independently agrees with the report's own M30.8 NOT READY
disposition:** 6 of 12 mandatory scenarios still lack real live
closure, scenario 9 remains scope-blocked, the template-inventory gap
is now confirmed. Real, incremental progress since Claude's pre-audit
(3 unambiguous passes → 4 LIVE_PASS + 1 residual + 1 correctly
scope-blocked), not yet sufficient against the migration plan's own
stated M30.8 bar.

**REQUIRED NEXT ACTION:**
Antigravity to record `LIVE_VERIFIED + CLAUDE ACCEPT` for M30.7A in
`docs/governance/URI_ACTIVE_MILESTONE.md`, and record the independently
confirmed `M30.8 NOT READY` disposition. M30.8 authorization remains
the User's own, non-delegable decision - not implied by this verdict.
If the User wants to proceed, the next bounded step would be closing
the specific remaining scenario gaps (2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12) and the
allowlist decision (§5 of the M30.7A plan) - not starting M30.8
directly.

**STOP CONDITIONS:**
- Do NOT start M30.8 - not authorized regardless of this verdict.
- Do NOT make canonical execution global.
- Do NOT touch `uri_ui/`.
- Do NOT commit or push without separate explicit User instruction.

**SUMMARY:**
Claude has completed and auto-approved M30.7A plan (`docs/plans/M30_7A_CANONICAL_LIVE_EVIDENCE_PLAN.md`).
Codex is tasked with executing M30.7A per `uri_workspace/dev_workflow/tasks/m30_7a_codex_implementation_task.txt`:
1. Apply confirmed bounded repair at `orchestrator.py:4586-4599` (threading `capability_id=model_capability_proposal` in `pre_execution_check`) and add focused unit test in `tests/test_workflow_continuation.py`.
2. Run live verification across all 12 mandatory scenarios from migration plan §14 under the binding disposition rubric (`LIVE_PASS`, `LIVE_FAIL`, `BLOCKED_BY_CURRENT_SCOPE`, `DOCUMENTED_ACCEPTED_RESIDUAL`).
3. Conduct structural demotion audit of `capability_planner.py`, `skill_memory.py`, `WorkflowPlanner`, `MultiActionDispatch`.
4. Run fresh full repository test suite and compare against the known 8-failure baseline.
5. Produce `docs/plans/M30_7A_CANONICAL_LIVE_EVIDENCE_REPORT.md` and advance state to `VERIFICATION_READY`.
6. Enforce hard stop at M30.8 boundary: return `M30.8 READY FOR USER APPROVAL` or `M30.8 NOT READY — <exact blockers>`.

**REQUIRED NEXT ACTION:**
Codex to implement bounded repair, execute live scenarios, perform structural demotion audit, run full regression suite, author `docs/plans/M30_7A_CANONICAL_LIVE_EVIDENCE_REPORT.md`, update `docs/plans/M30_7A_STATE.md` to `VERIFICATION_READY`, and update this mailbox to:

- `docs/governance/URI_ACTIVE_MILESTONE.md` (updated)
- `docs/plans/M30_7_CLAUDE_AUDIT.md`

**SUMMARY:**
Per explicit User direction: "I accept M30.7 as sufficiently proven...
Do not spend more time on open-ended phrasing experiments." Claude
recorded final disposition:

- **CURRENT STATE** advanced from `LIVE_VERIFIED + CLAUDE ACCEPT WITH
  FOLLOW-UP` to `LIVE_VERIFIED + CLAUDE ACCEPT (documented residual)` -
  M30.7 is CLOSED, not pending further work.
- **Documented residual (accepted, non-blocking):** the repaired
  `post_execution_reevaluation` workflow-continuation mechanism is
  implemented and unit/integration verified; its dependencies (§2F
  precedence, §2B gate resolution, §2C execution reuse) are
  live-proven; current model behavior (qwen3:14b) often asks for
  clarification upfront rather than attempt-then-reask, so the
  repaired path was not organically triggered across four honest live
  attempts; this is a known model decision-behavior limitation, not
  evidence the mechanism is broken.
- **Non-blocking debt, recorded separately:** the pre-existing
  `decide_fallback_reason()` telemetry-ordering oddity
  (`capability_not_allowlisted` shown instead of `mode_not_executable`
  for no-capability decisions) - unchanged since M30.6, not conflated
  with the residual above.
- Updated `docs/governance/URI_ACTIVE_MILESTONE.md` directly per the
  User's explicit instruction to do so this round.

**REQUIRED NEXT ACTION:**
Antigravity to treat M30.7 as closed at `LIVE_VERIFIED + CLAUDE ACCEPT
(documented residual)`. Hand this state back into the normal loop
bookkeeping. **Stop at the M30.8 approval boundary** - do not prepare,
propose, or begin M30.8 work; `NEXT MILESTONE STATUS` remains `NOT
AUTHORIZED` until the User explicitly approves M30.8 through Claude,
per the standing User Approval Channel Protocol.

**STOP CONDITIONS:**
- Do NOT start or prepare M30.8 - explicit User instruction this round,
  independent of the standing NOT AUTHORIZED default.
- Do NOT touch `uri_ui/`.
- Do NOT commit or push without separate explicit User instruction.
- Do NOT run further live-verification phrasing experiments against
  the documented residual - explicitly closed by the User.

ACCEPT WITH FOLLOW-UP

**TIMESTAMP:**
2026-09-13T13:30:00Z

**AUTHORITATIVE ARTIFACTS:**
- `docs/plans/M30_7_CLAUDE_AUDIT.md` (addendum)

**SUMMARY:**
Independently verified the v4 source fix directly in
`orchestrator.py:2790-2805` - matches plan exactly, real data
(`attempt_history[-1]["proposal"]["capability"]`), never guessed.
Independently re-ran regression (137/137 via pytest, zero failures,
matches report's 125/125 via unittest - runner-discovery difference,
not a real discrepancy). Independently cross-checked
`canonical_execution_log.jsonl`: all four live attempts (v3's
`extract_student_records` + three v4 Gmail phrasings) genuinely landed
on the `initial_reasoning` clarification site (`capability_id: null`
by design, correct), not `post_execution_reevaluation` - confirms the
report honestly, no fabrication.

**Assessment of the two framings the task posed:** this is not
"accept the organic-first-clarification behavior as sufficient" vs.
"require a prompt fix" as a binary - it's that four honest, non-seeded
attempts have consistently hit the same (correctly-unchanged) call
site because this model has a documented, pre-existing tendency
(M30.4) to ask upfront rather than attempt-then-reask. The `post_
execution_reevaluation` fix itself is source-correct and unit-tested
regardless. Recommend the loop stop blind rephrasing and pick
explicitly: (a) accept the mechanism as sufficiently proven given unit
coverage + the already-live-proven surrounding pipeline (Scenario 4/11
resolve-and-execute halves), documenting this specific organic-trigger
gap as a tracked residual, or (b) one deliberately-shaped attempt (a
request specific enough to make the model try a real Gmail action
first, vague enough that it can't fully succeed) rather than another
guess at phrasing. Full reasoning in `M30_7_CLAUDE_AUDIT.md` addendum
§10.

One incidental, pre-existing, non-blocking observation: `decide_
fallback_reason()` reports `capability_not_allowlisted` for a
no-capability `clarification`/`conversation` decision rather than
`mode_not_executable:<mode>` (allowlist check runs before mode check)
- unchanged since M30.6, not a v4 regression, not worth a repair on
its own.

**REQUIRED NEXT ACTION:**
1. Antigravity/User to choose (a) or (b) above - not a repair
   requirement, a scope/patience decision.
2. If (a): Antigravity records `LIVE_VERIFIED + CLAUDE ACCEPT WITH
   FOLLOW-UP` in `URI_ACTIVE_MILESTONE.md`; M30.8 authorization remains
   the User's separate decision regardless.
3. If (b): Antigravity routes one deliberately-shaped live-attempt
   task to Codex per the addendum's own description - not another
   open-ended retry.

**STOP CONDITIONS:**
- Do NOT start M30.8 - not authorized regardless of this verdict.
- Do NOT touch `uri_ui/`.
- Do NOT commit or push without separate explicit User instruction.
- Do NOT expand `CANONICAL_EXECUTION_ALLOWLIST`.
- No seeded/manually-inserted pending state for any further live

With all three required flags, a fresh authenticated `URI_test2` login, and
authenticated `/connections` confirming Gmail `connected`, the unseeded
`Search my email.` turn still paused before the Brain proposed Gmail. Its
persisted clarification consequently has `capability_id: null`; no
capability-bearing pointer exists to resume, and no state was seeded. The
topic-switch regression passed (fresh weather turn, no active workflow). Full
sanitized evidence is in `M30_7_WORKFLOW_CONTINUATION_REPORT.md`.

`VERIFICATION_READY` is not claimed because the required organic allowlisted
continuation chain (`workflow_continuation` → `READY` → canonical success) was
not produced by the live Brain.

**SUMMARY:**
Codex implemented the bounded revision-v4 capability-id threading repair and
added its focused regression; focused proof passed 1/1 and the mandated suite
passed 124/124. The live authenticated proof is blocked because `/connections`
reports Gmail `needs_authorization`: unseeded natural Gmail requests pause
before a capability is proposed, so no capability-id-bearing continuation state
or allowlisted execution can be truthfully produced. Topic-switch passed. See
the revision-v4 report section for sanitized evidence.

Claude has published M30.7 Plan REVISION v4 specifying:
1. Thread `capability_id` from `attempt_history[-1]["proposal"].get("capability")` into `_apply_clarification_pause` at the `"post_execution_reevaluation"` call site in `uri_core/core/orchestrator.py` (~2790).
2. Run regressions (124+ tests).
3. Execute the mandatory organic two-turn live verification using an already-allowlisted capability (e.g. Gmail search missing query, `"Search my email."` → `"insurance"`) and verify topic-switch regression.

Antigravity hands off to Codex for implementation and live verification.

**REQUIRED NEXT ACTION:**
Restore usable Gmail authorization on the server host, then rerun the
documented authenticated unseeded two-turn scenario. Do not seed pending state

**AUTHORITATIVE ARTIFACTS:**
- `docs/plans/M30_7_WORKFLOW_CONTINUATION_PLAN.md` (REVISION v4)
- `docs/plans/M30_7_STATE.md`

**SUMMARY:**
Traced why `session.active_workflow` stayed empty for "Find the
student." per the 3 requested questions:

1. **Component:** `extract_student_records` (`uri_core/tools/extract_
   student_records.py`) is a plain single-call regex tool - no
   `WorkflowCapabilityRouter`/`get_next_question` registration
   (confirmed by grep, no match). When it finds no roll number, the
   free-text Brain reasoning loop asks via `_apply_clarification_
   pause`'s `"post_execution_reevaluation"` call site
   (`orchestrator.py:2790-2798`) - not `_save_paused_workflow`.
2. **Not a persistence bug:** `_save_paused_workflow()` was never
   supposed to fire for this capability. The real gap: that call site
   still passes no `capability_id` even though `attempt_history` (its
   own `attempt_history_so_far` argument, line 2797) already contains
   the just-executed attempt with `proposal.capability` set (same
   shape confirmed at `orchestrator.py:2882-2889`).
3. **Bounded fix:** derive `capability_id` from `attempt_history[-1]
   ["proposal"].get("capability")` when `proposal["type"] ==
   "capability"`, pass it into the existing `_apply_clarification_
   pause(..., capability_id=...)` parameter (already built in §2D/v2 -
   this just populates it from real data at one more call site).
   `action`/`known_inputs`/`missing_field` stay `None`/`{}` here -
   this tool has no structured schema to draw them from.

**Also corrected:** REVISION v3's Outcome B conclusion was right in
general (`active_workflow` genuinely is the real mechanism when it's
what fires) but wrong for `extract_student_records` specifically -
`M30_5A_DECISION_QUALITY_REMEDIATION_REPORT.md` had already documented
this exact example goes through the ad hoc path, a finding Claude had
read earlier this session but didn't re-apply carefully when writing
v3. Corrected in v4, disclosed here rather than silently patched.

**Flagged, not actioned:** `extract_student_records` is not in
`canonical_execution.py`'s `CANONICAL_EXECUTION_ALLOWLIST` (`{Gmail,
remember_fact}` only, from M30.6) - even with `capability_id` resolved
and gate `READY`, canonical execution would refuse it
(`capability_not_allowlisted`). Expanding that allowlist is a real,
separate scope decision (Strict Boundary #6) - not made here.
**Recommendation:** prove the mandatory organic scenario against an
already-allowlisted capability instead (Gmail `search_messages`
missing `query` is the closest real analog), with a real fallback to
whatever the live model actually organically pauses on - never
scripted, never seeded, per REVISION v4's own "Mandatory live scenario
(v4)" section.

**REQUIRED NEXT ACTION:**
1. Antigravity to route the bounded `orchestrator.py:2790-2798`
   capability_id-threading fix (plan REVISION v4) to Codex.
2. Codex implements, re-runs the full regression set (should stay
   green - additive, `None` when no prior attempt).
3. Codex performs the mandatory organic live scenario per REVISION v4
   (Gmail-preferred, real fallback allowed, no seeding) plus re-confirms
   the topic-switch regression still passes.
4. Antigravity collects evidence, hands back to Claude for re-audit
   against real telemetry/session-state artifacts.

**STOP CONDITIONS:**
- Do NOT start M30.8.
- Do NOT touch `uri_ui/`.
- Do NOT commit or push.
- Do NOT expand `CANONICAL_EXECUTION_ALLOWLIST` - flagged for User/
  Antigravity awareness only, not authorized by this revision.
- No seeded/manually-inserted pending state for the live scenario.
- Scope strictly bounded to `M30_7_WORKFLOW_CONTINUATION_PLAN.md`
  REVISION v4.

**SUMMARY:**
Codex implemented REVISION v3 bounded `turn_state.py` projection (124/124 tests pass).
The organic topic-switch regression passed.
However, the unseeded primary two-turn live proof revealed that when `"Find the student."` returns `waiting_for_input`, `active_workflow` and `active_workflow_status` are NOT persisted on the session state. Turn 2 (`"B250012CS."`) therefore finds no active pointer and asks for clarification again.
Antigravity routes to Claude for architectural trace and Plan REVISION v4 per `claude_m30_7_trace_task.txt`.

**REQUIRED NEXT ACTION:**
Claude to trace why `/ask` missing-input response does not persist `session.active_workflow` on session, produce `docs/plans/M30_7_WORKFLOW_CONTINUATION_PLAN.md` (REVISION v4) with the bounded fix, and update this mailbox to:

M30.7 — Workflow Continuation & Active Pointer (REVISION v3)

**HANDOFF TYPE:**
IMPLEMENTATION

**STATUS:**
COMPLETE — SOURCE AND REGRESSION COMPLETE; ORGANIC PRIMARY LIVE PROOF BLOCKED

**TIMESTAMP:**
2026-09-13T09:57:00Z

**SUMMARY:**
- Patched `uri_core/core/turn_state.py::_project_active_pointer()` so the
  active-workflow projection returns its persisted `action` and a copied
  `session.current_facts` `known_inputs` map; the empty projection now returns
  `known_inputs: {}`. Added the focused active-workflow projection test in
  `test_workflow_continuation.py`.
- Required regression suite passed: **124 tests, 0 failures** using
  `.venv\Scripts\python.exe`.
- Ran real loopback `/auth/login` and `/ask` calls for `URI_test2` with all
  three required feature flags. The unseeded first primary turn genuinely
  returned `waiting_for_input`, but persisted session state had
  `active_workflow: null`, `active_workflow_status: null`, and zero current
  facts. The same-session identifier answer again returned `waiting_for_input`.
  Therefore the required `workflow_continuation` → `READY` → canonical-success
  proof cannot be claimed without seeding state.
- The organic topic-switch regression passed: second unread-email request had
  execution `success`, Gmail/unread-email response indication, and no active
  workflow persisted after the turn.

**REQUIRED DISPOSITION:**

M30.7 must remain `IMPLEMENTING`; do not mark `VERIFICATION_READY`. Claude/
Antigravity should trace why the live missing-input path does not invoke
`_save_paused_workflow` under the required flags before routing any further
bounded repair. Sanitized evidence is appended to
`docs/plans/M30_7_WORKFLOW_CONTINUATION_REPORT.md`.

**SUMMARY:**
Claude has published M30.7 Plan REVISION v3 specifying the bounded completion for `turn_state.py::_project_active_pointer()` (Outcome B):
1. In `active_workflow` branch, project `"action": (active_workflow or {}).get("action")` and `"known_inputs": dict(getattr(session, "current_facts", None) or {})`.
2. Run regressions (123+ tests).
3. Execute mandatory organic two-turn live scenario ("Find the student." → "B250012CS.") and topic-switch regression against the live authenticated `/ask` route.

Antigravity hands off to Codex for direct implementation and live verification.

**REQUIRED NEXT ACTION:**
Codex to implement the bounded completion in `turn_state.py`, run regressions, execute the organic live verification, update `docs/plans/M30_7_WORKFLOW_CONTINUATION_REPORT.md`, update `docs/plans/M30_7_STATE.md` to `VERIFICATION_READY`, and update this mailbox to:

**AUTHORITATIVE ARTIFACTS:**
- `docs/plans/M30_7_WORKFLOW_CONTINUATION_PLAN.md` (REVISION v3)
- `docs/plans/M30_7_STATE.md`

**SUMMARY:**
Per the User's direct instruction, Claude traced the real pause path
before writing any code, answering all 5 required questions from
source (full trace in plan REVISION v3):

1. The real path that asks for missing information on a *known*
   capability (e.g. "Find the student." → missing roll number) is
   `session.active_workflow`/`_save_paused_workflow`
   (`orchestrator.py:3532-3571`) + `WorkflowCapabilityRouter`'s
   question step (`workflow_capability_router.py:316-341`) - a
   separate, pre-existing (pre-M30.7) mechanism from
   `_apply_clarification_pause`.
2. It already knows `capability_id` (`active_workflow.get("capability")
   or .get("task")`) and `missing_field` (`active_workflow_required_
   field`) - both pre-existing, unchanged since M30.5A. It does NOT
   currently project `action` or `known_inputs`, though both are
   available from data already on session (`active_workflow.get
   ("action")`, `session.current_facts` - `state.py:19`, already
   persisted).
3. `_apply_clarification_pause`'s 3 call sites don't have this data
   because they are a *different* mechanism - re-confirmed each fires
   only when the Brain proposed no capability/workflow at all
   (`orchestrator.py` ~2725-2778 and equivalent), genuinely nothing to
   thread through. Not an oversight; §2D's fix was correctly scoped to
   a real but different case.
4. The earlier canonical objects holding the missing metadata:
   `session.active_workflow` and `session.current_facts`, both
   pre-existing.
5. **Yes - `active_workflow` is already the real production
   continuation source (Outcome B).** No second pause/workflow engine
   is being proposed.

**Decision: Outcome B, plus one small bounded completion (not a new
mechanism).** `turn_state.py::_project_active_pointer()`'s
active_workflow branch (lines 198-225) should also project `action`
and `known_inputs` (from `active_workflow.get("action")` and
`session.current_facts` respectively) - exactly mirroring what the
attempt_history branch (§2D) already does. No change needed to
`decision_gates.py` (it already reads these fields generically) or to
`_save_paused_workflow`/`WorkflowCapabilityRouter`. Full spec in plan
REVISION v3. Marked ACCEPTED under the standing auto-approval rule per
the User's own "do not ask again for routine same-milestone repair"
instruction. No production code written by Claude.

**REQUIRED NEXT ACTION:**
1. Antigravity to route the bounded `turn_state.py` completion (plan
   REVISION v3, "Decision" section) to Codex.
2. Codex implements the two-field projection completion, re-runs
   `test_workflow_continuation.py` + the full M30.7-adjacent regression
   set (should stay green - additive fields, `None`/`{}` when absent).
3. Codex then performs the **mandatory organic live scenario** (plan
   REVISION v3): "Find the student." (real `/ask`, real principal, no
   seeded state) → verify the pause was created organically via real
   session-state inspection → "B250012CS." → `workflow_continuation` →
   `READY` → real execution → grounded response. Plus the topic-switch
   regression ("Find the student." → "How many unread emails do I
   have?" → newest intent wins, Gmail path, NOT continuation).
4. Antigravity collects evidence (sanitized telemetry + session-state
   artifacts, no student-record content) and hands back to Claude for
   re-audit.
5. Claude re-audits against real artifacts (not the report's narrative
   alone, per this session's own established practice) and, if clean,
   returns `LIVE_VERIFIED + CLAUDE ACCEPT` (no follow-up qualifier).

**STOP CONDITIONS:**
- Do NOT start M30.8 - not authorized.
- Do NOT touch `uri_ui/`.
- Do NOT commit or push without separate explicit User instruction.
- Do NOT build a second workflow/pause engine - this is a two-field
   read-side projection completion only.
- No seeded/manually-inserted `active_workflow` for the mandatory
   scenario - it must be produced by a real first `/ask` turn.
- Scope strictly bounded to `M30_7_WORKFLOW_CONTINUATION_PLAN.md`
   REVISION v3's "Decision" section.

**SUMMARY:**
All 123 automated M30.7 regression tests remain passing. Codex completed the
mandatory live verification through the real authenticated FastAPI `/ask`
route using a freshly issued `URI_test2` bearer token and the three specified
feature flags. No executor, principal, capability grant, Gmail service, or
model result was mocked or bypassed.

Scenario 4 passed: a durable Gmail/search-messages pending interaction received
its answer and canonical telemetry recorded `workflow_continuation`, `READY`,
canonical `success`, returned execution evidence, and grounded final response.
Scenario 11 passed: the fresh weather request caused the early canonical
non-continuation decision, cleared the actual `waiting_for_input` workflow,
and then processed the message fresh rather than resuming legacy work.
Sanitized telemetry/session proof is in
`docs/plans/M30_7_WORKFLOW_CONTINUATION_REPORT.md`.

**REQUIRED NEXT ACTION:**

**AUTHORITATIVE ARTIFACTS:**
- `docs/plans/M30_7_WORKFLOW_CONTINUATION_PLAN.md` (REVISION v2)
- `docs/plans/M30_7_STATE.md`

**SUMMARY:**
Claude independently re-verified both gaps Codex reported directly
against source (not taken on the report alone) - both confirmed real:

1. **Precedence (Scenario 11), confirmed:** `server.py:1149` calls
   `process_user_input()` before `run_canonical_for_ask()` (line
   1199); `orchestrator.py:4223-4240` unconditionally resumes any
   pending `active_workflow` inside the former, before canonical
   continuation logic ever runs.
2. **Missing durable metadata (Scenario 4), confirmed:**
   `_apply_clarification_pause` (`orchestrator.py:1747`) and
   `turn_state.py`'s attempt_history-sourced `active_pointer` branch
   (lines 227-256) never carry `capability_id`/`action`/
   `missing_field` - hardcoded `None`, by the code's own documented
   design.

Also found and corrected a design error in v1 itself while
investigating Gap 1: v1's §2E proposed a "deterministic goal-
continuity check" reusing `classify_agreement()` - re-checked against
`M30_5D_TEMPORARY_CONTEXT_INTENT_SHIFT_REPORT.md`, this function does
not exist as a live gate and should not be built as one;
continuation-vs-new-intent is a deliberate model judgment inside the
Decision Contract's own 1a-1d sequence, consistent with this project's
standing rule against narrowing the Brain's cognition into a rigid
pre-model check.

**Plan revised (REVISION v2, same file):**
- §2B/§2D: `_apply_clarification_pause` gains optional
  `capability_id`/`action`/`known_inputs`/`missing_field` params,
  threaded through per-call-site (audited individually, never
  fabricated); `turn_state.py` reads them instead of hardcoding
  `None`, falling back exactly as today when absent.
- §2E: corrected - no new comparison function; the model's existing
  1a-1d judgment is reused, just needs to run earlier.
- §2F (new): a narrowly-scoped, flag-gated `server.py` block runs
  canonical execution *before* `process_user_input()`, but only when a
  workflow is genuinely pending - three outcomes (continue-and-
  execute / clear-stale-and-fall-through-fresh / fallback-to-today).
  Every other `/ask` case, and the flag-off case, is byte-for-byte
  unchanged.
- §3: file list now includes `uri_core/app/server.py`.

v2 marked ACCEPTED under the standing auto-approval rule
(`ORCHESTRATION.md` §1.5). No production code was written by Claude -
plan/architecture only, per governance's explicit instruction.

**REQUIRED NEXT ACTION:**
1. Antigravity to record the `server.py` write-scope expansion in
   `docs/governance/URI_ACTIVE_MILESTONE.md` §4 (narrowly: the `/ask`
   handler's pending-workflow branch, per plan §2F) - Claude does not
   self-edit that file's scope list (Write Ownership).
2. Antigravity to hand the revised plan to Codex for re-implementation,
   scoped exactly to `M30_7_WORKFLOW_CONTINUATION_PLAN.md` REVISION v2
   §2-§5.
3. Codex implements, runs the plan's own regression list (§7), and
   produces live evidence for Scenarios 4 and 11 per §5 (real `/ask`
   HTTP calls, real authenticated principal - a bypassed/directly-
   constructed principal does not satisfy this bar, per M30.6A's own
   audit finding) before returning to Claude for independent audit.

**STOP CONDITIONS:**
- Do NOT start M30.8 - not authorized.
- Do NOT touch `uri_ui/`.
- Do NOT commit or push M30.6A or M30.7 without separate explicit User
  instruction.
- `server.py` scope expansion is narrow (§2F's one guarded block) -
  not a general reopening of `server.py` for unrelated edits.
- `enable_workflow_continuation_mode` must ship default-off; flag-off
  behavior, and the no-pending-workflow case, must be byte-for-byte
  unchanged from pre-M30.7.

**VERDICT:**
READY_WITH_CHANGES (independent review of Codex's 2026-09-15 draft) → findings incorporated → BLUEPRINT FROZEN.

**SUMMARY:**
Claude independently reviewed Codex's 2026-09-15 UI overhaul planning draft against the real repository (backend endpoints, current Flutter structure, `URI_ACTIVE_MILESTONE.md`/M31 state) and against the published Hybrid Artifact, which Claude accessed directly via the Artifact tool (`read`) — contrary to the draft's belief that it was blocked by a sign-in wall. Findings: (1) the draft's role change ("Antigravity excluded, Claude read-only") rested on an unverified claim; the User has since directly set the roles recorded in `ORCHESTRATION.md` §0 for this initiative. (2) The draft's write scope collides with M31's still-open, broad `uri_ui/` write scope; implementation is now hard-sequenced behind M31 `VERIFIED`+committed (see `URI_ACTIVE_MILESTONE.md` §1a). (3) The draft's authority docs miscounted Home's tile grid (said 4, artifact has 6, two of which are exactly the fabricated-metric pattern the same docs forbid) — corrected in `UI_DESIGN_AUTHORITY.md`/`COMPONENT_MAPPING.md` to the 4 real-backed tiles only. (4) The Mobile artboard has real layouts only for Home/Chat; Tasks/Connections & Providers/Settings are explicit placeholders — recorded as net-new responsive design work in the blueprint's Batch 4. (5) No `docs/design_library/approved/` record existed for the Hybrid direction; now created. (6) Bottom-nav-vs-drawer resolved from the artifact's own `MobileApp.dc.html` (bottom nav, 5 items, "Connect" abbreviated label) rather than left open. (7) M31's real `ChooseModelPopover`/`ModelSelectorChip` behavior (verified-only selection, disabled+reason for unverified) is specified as the required implementation underneath the Hybrid composer's visual position — the artifact's own flat always-enabled dropdown is visual reference only, not the behavior to copy. User accepted `READY_WITH_CHANGES` and directed Claude to produce the frozen blueprint incorporating all of the above; Claude did so and stopped, per instruction, without starting implementation or another review cycle.
