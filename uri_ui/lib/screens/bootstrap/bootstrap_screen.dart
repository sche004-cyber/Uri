/// configured (see AppState.hasConfiguredServerAddress) - closes the

/// wrong address, but Settings itself was only reachable after logging
/// in, which could never succeed against a wrong address in the first
/// place.
///
/// Deliberately thin: reuses [ServerAddressSection] (the exact same
/// widget Settings uses) and AppState's existing
/// setBaseUrl/checkConnection - no new networking logic, no new
/// backend endpoint, no way to reach anything beyond the already-
/// unauthenticated GET /health this device would otherwise use anyway.
/// The moment a typed address tests successfully, it is applied (via
/// setBaseUrl, exactly as Save already does) and AppState.
/// hasConfiguredServerAddress flips true - main.dart's root
/// ListenableBuilder reacts immediately and swaps this screen for the
/// login screen, with no separate "Continue" step to click through.
